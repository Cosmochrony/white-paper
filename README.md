Cosmochrony is a **pre-geometric theoretical framework** in which time ordering,
spacetime geometry, dynamics, and matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation
of a single **relational substrate**, denoted $\chi$.

The framework does not assume a pre-existing spacetime manifold, metric,
or fundamental quantization.
Instead, familiar physical structures arise as **regime-dependent effective
descriptions**, valid only in *projectable regimes*, obtained through projection
and coarse-graining of the underlying $\chi$ dynamics.

## Core Thesis

Cosmochrony is based on the following central statements:

1. **Time is not fundamental**  
   Time corresponds to the intrinsically directed (irreversible) relaxation or
   ordering of $\chi$, rather than to an external parameter or coordinate.
1. **Spacetime is emergent**  
   Spacetime geometry arises as an effective, continuum encoding of microscopic
   relational connectivity.
   In projectable regimes, it can be reconstructed from the spectral properties
   of the underlying relational structure.
1. **Observables are projected quantities**  
   Physical observables belong to an effective spacetime-level descriptor
   $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$, obtained through a generally non-injective projection
   from $\chi$.
   As a result, effective descriptions generically underdetermine the underlying
   configuration, limiting reconstruction beyond operational observables.
1. **Dynamics are derived, not postulated**  
   The effective dynamical law governing $\chi$ is obtained ab initio from
   structural constraints on relaxation and causal saturation of fluxes.
   The resulting Born–Infeld–like action is not a fundamental postulate but the
   unique effective encoding compatible with these constraints within
   projectable spacetime regimes.

## The $\chi$ Substrate

- $\chi$ is **not a field defined on spacetime**
- it is a **pre-geometric, relational substrate**
- it does not carry values in space or time
- spacetime notions arise only after projection

A key distinction is made between:

- **$\chi$**, the fundamental relational substrate
- **$\chi_{eff}$**, an effective scalar descriptor used once a stable geometric regime exists

The mapping $\chi \rightarrow \chi_{eff}$ is mediated by a **projection fiber $\Pi$**, and is generally 
**non-injective**. This non-injectivity constrains reconstruction, underlies effective indeterminacy,
and plays a central role in the emergence of quantum-like behavior.

## Causality and Bounds

Cosmochrony distinguishes between:

- **$c_{\chi}$**: a structural bound governing pre-temporal relaxation fluxes
- **$c$**: the emergent causal constraint within effective spacetime descriptions

Relativistic causality is recovered as an effective limit of more primitive
pre-geometric saturation constraints, avoiding circularity between geometry
and dynamics.

## Matter, Charge, Gravitation, and Spectra

Within Cosmochrony:

- **Localized, stable configurations** of $\chi$ correspond to matter-like excitations
- Stability is characterized by **spectral and topological invariants**, not by
  fundamental couplings
- Mass arises from resistance to relaxation
- Electric charge is interpreted as a **chiral–torsional invariant** of bounded relaxation fluxes
- Gravitation emerges from sustained constraints on $\chi$ relaxation, recovered as an effective geometric description

Spacetime curvature, time dilation, and gravitational dynamics arise as
thermodynamic or continuum limits of relational structure.

## Quantum-like Phenomena

Quantum behavior is not postulated as fundamental.

Instead:

- quantization arises only at the effective level
- quantum correlations emerge from shared $\chi$ configurations and projection
  structure
- nonlocal correlations do not require superluminal influence
- the wavefunction is an effective descriptor, not an ontological object

## Cosmology and Strong-Gravity Regimes

CCosmological and strong-gravity phenomena follow from the same underlying
relaxation dynamics:

- large-scale expansion reflects global relaxation structure
- apparent acceleration arises cumulatively and is regime-dependent
- horizon-like thresholds correspond to **deprojection regimes** where effective
  spacetime descriptions become fragile
- black-hole-like behavior is reinterpreted in terms of relaxation saturation and
  reprojection dynamics

These regimes provide concrete avenues for phenomenological exploration and
potential empirical constraints.

## Status of the Framework

Cosmochrony is:

- **foundational and pre-geometric**
- **conceptually closed at the dynamical level**
- **incomplete at the phenomenological and experimental level**

It does **not** claim:

- experimental validation
- full derivation of all Standard Model phenomenology
- final unification

It **does** provide:

- a uniquely derived dynamical core
- a coherent ontological structure
- explicit effective limits
- well-defined directions for falsifiable development
