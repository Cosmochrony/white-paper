Cosmochrony is a **pre-geometric theoretical framework** in which time ordering,
spacetime geometry, dynamics, and matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation
of a single **relational substrate**, denoted $\chi$.

The framework does not assume a pre-existing spacetime manifold, metric,
fundamental fields, or quantization postulates.
Instead, familiar physical structures arise as **regime-dependent effective
descriptions**, valid only in *projectable regimes*, obtained through a generally
non-injective projection of the underlying $\chi$ dynamics.

## Core Thesis

Cosmochrony is built around the following central statements:

1. **Time is not fundamental**  
   Physical time corresponds to the intrinsically directed (irreversible)
   ordering of $\chi$ relaxation, rather than to an external parameter
   or coordinate.

1. **Spacetime is emergent**  
   Spacetime geometry arises as an effective, continuum encoding of
   relational connectivity within $\chi$.
   In projectable regimes, it can be reconstructed from spectral
   and correlation properties of the underlying relational structure.

1. **Observables are projected quantities**  
   Physical observables belong to an effective descriptor
   $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$, obtained through a generally **non-injective**
   projection from $\chi$.
   As a result, effective descriptions underdetermine the underlying
   configuration, imposing intrinsic limits on reconstruction and
   factorization.

1. **Dynamics are derived, not postulated**  
   The effective dynamical law governing admissible regimes is obtained
   *ab initio* from structural constraints on relaxation and causal
   saturation of fluxes.
   The resulting Born–Infeld–like action is not a fundamental postulate,
   but the unique effective encoding compatible with bounded relaxation
   and projectability.

## The $\chi$ Substrate

The substrate $\chi$ is:

- **not a field defined on spacetime**
- **pre-geometric and relational**
- devoid of intrinsic spatial or temporal localization
- defined prior to any metric, coordinate, or causal structure

Spacetime notions arise only after projection.

A fundamental distinction is made between:

- **$\chi$**, the infra-physical relational substrate
- **$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$**, an effective scalar descriptor used only
  once a stable geometric regime exists

The mapping $\chi \rightarrow \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is mediated by a
**projection fiber $\Pi$** and is generically **non-injective**.
This non-injectivity is structural, not epistemic: it constrains
reconstruction, underlies effective indeterminacy, and plays a central
role in the emergence of quantum-like behavior.

## Causality, Saturation, and Bounds

Cosmochrony distinguishes between:

- **$c_{\chi}$**: an invariant structural bound governing pre-temporal
  relaxation fluxes in the $\chi$ substrate
- **$c$**: the emergent causal constraint appearing within effective
  spacetime descriptions

Relativistic causality is recovered as a projective limit of more
primitive saturation constraints, avoiding circular dependence between
geometry and dynamics.

Planck’s constant $\hbar$ arises analogously as a bound on the minimal
resolvable granularity of reprojection, placing relativistic and quantum
limits on a common structural footing.

## Matter, Charge, Gravitation, and Spectral Structure

Within Cosmochrony:

- **Localized, stable configurations** of $\chi$ correspond to
  matter-like excitations
- Stability is characterized by **spectral and topological invariants**
  rather than fundamental couplings
- Mass emerges as resistance to relaxation ordering
- Electric charge is interpreted as a **chiral–torsional invariant**
  of bounded relaxation fluxes
- Gravitation arises from sustained inhibition of relaxation and is
  recovered as an effective geometric description

Spacetime curvature, time dilation, and gravitational dynamics emerge as
continuum and thermodynamic limits of relational structure, rather than
as fundamental interactions.

## Quantum-like Phenomena

Quantum behavior is not postulated as fundamental.

Instead:

- quantization arises only at the effective level
- quantum correlations emerge from shared underlying $\chi$
  configurations and non-factorizable projection
- violations of Bell inequalities follow from non-injective projection,
  without invoking superluminal influence or dynamical nonlocality
- the wavefunction is an effective descriptor, not an ontological object

Classical behavior is recovered when the effective projection becomes
approximately injective.

## Cosmology and Strong-Gravity Regimes

Cosmological and strong-gravity phenomena follow from the same bounded
relaxation dynamics:

- large-scale expansion reflects global relaxation ordering
- apparent acceleration is cumulative and regime-dependent
- the Hubble tension arises from projective and relaxation effects,
  without dark energy
- flat galactic rotation curves follow from saturation of relaxation
  dynamics, without dark matter particles
- horizon-like thresholds correspond to **deprojection regimes** where
  effective spacetime descriptions lose validity
- black-hole-like behavior is reinterpreted in terms of relaxation
  saturation and reprojection dynamics

These regimes provide concrete avenues for phenomenological tests and
falsifiable predictions with current and forthcoming observational
programs.

## Status of the Framework

Cosmochrony is:

- **foundational and pre-geometric**
- **dynamically closed at the structural level**
- **phenomenologically incomplete**

It does **not** claim:

- experimental validation
- full derivation of the Standard Model
- final unification

It **does** provide:

- a uniquely derived dynamical core
- a coherent and explicitly stated minimal ontology
- well-defined effective limits
- quantitative and falsifiable directions for further development
