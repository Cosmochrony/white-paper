\subsection{Renormalization of Substrate Parameters}
  \label{subsec:renormalization}

  To maintain consistency between the fundamental definition of $\hbar_\chi$
  and the scale-dependent observations in Appendix D, we distinguish between:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bare Parameters ($K_0, \chi_c$):} Universal invariants of the $\chi$
    substrate that determine the fundamental quantum of action $\hbar_\chi$.
    \item \textbf{Effective Parameters ($K_{\text{eff}}, \chi_{\text{eff}}$):}
    Environment-dependent values emerging from the coarse-graining of relaxation constraints, as detailed in
    Section~\ref{sec:appendix-technical}.
  \end{itemize}

  The universality of $\hbar$ and the spectral invariant $\alpha_{\text{spec}}$ (formerly $\alpha$
  in Section B.9) stems from their dependence on the ratio of these bare quantities, which remains invariant under
  projective scaling \emph{within a given relaxation epoch}.

  \noindent
  In particular, dimensionless coupling constants such as the electromagnetic fine-structure constant
  $\alpha_{\mathrm{EM}}$ do not inherit any arbitrariness from the substrate parameters (this statement concerns
  structural invariance, not a first-principles derivation of their numerical values).
  Within the Cosmochrony framework, the electric charge $e$ is not treated as a free gauge parameter, but as a property
  of localized solitonic configurations.
  The associated transmittance is not an adjustable quantity but a geometric invariant of the soliton's spectral
  embedding relative to the projection fiber~$\Pi$.
  As a result, the dependence on the substrate rigidity $K_0$ cancels out in dimensionless ratios, ensuring their
  invariance within a fixed relaxation epoch up to higher-order projection corrections.

  \paragraph{Summary.}

    Within Cosmochrony, both inertial mass and effective quantization emerge from the same spectral stability structure
    of the \(\chi\) relaxation dynamics.
    The Planck constant appears not as a fundamental input, but as a scale-dependent effective parameter encoding the
    projection from relational dynamics to spacetime-based observables.
