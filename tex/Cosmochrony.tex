\abstract{
  We propose \emph{Cosmochrony}, a foundational physical framework in which time, inertia,
  and spacetime geometry emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single fundamental
  entity $\chi$. Unlike conventional field theories defined on a pre-existing spacetime,
  Cosmochrony treats relaxation as the primary physical process from which
  temporal ordering, effective metrics, and dynamical laws are derived \emph{ab initio}.

  Localized, long-lived excitations of the $\chi$ substrate appear as topologically
  and spectrally stable solitonic configurations. Their inertial mass is not postulated
  but emerges as a measure of resistance to global relaxation, quantified by the
  stability spectrum of the configuration. By resolving the circularity between
  configuration and distance through spectral graph theory, the effective metric
  becomes an emergent property. This interpretation naturally reproduces $E = mc^2$
  as a kinematic identity, while spin, statistics, and fermionic $4\pi$ periodicity
  originate from topological obstructions in the configuration space of $\chi$.

  The Standard Model phenomenology emerges as a projection $\Pi$ of the substrate's
  dynamics. We reinterpret gauge mediators as specific projection modes: the photon
  as scalar transmittance, and the $W/Z$ bosons as shear modes of the projection fiber,
  accounting for their mass without a fundamental Higgs field. Instead, mass generation
  arises from the \emph{spectral overlap} between localized modes and the relaxation
  background. Strong interactions and confinement are shown to be consequences of
  topological stability in knotted configurations ($Q=3$), where the color charge
  reflects internal degrees of geometric coherence.

  Across physical regimes, the framework suggests that the fine-structure constant
  $\alpha$ emerges as a universal spectral invariant, bridging particle-scale stability
  and strong-gravity relaxation thresholds. At cosmological scales, Cosmochrony provides
  a unified interpretation of the ``dark sector'': Dark Matter is identified as
  non-projected spectral density (sub-threshold inertia), while Dark Energy
  manifests the global, irreversible relaxation flux.

  Cosmochrony does not aim to replace the Standard Model or General Relativity at
  accessible energies, but to supply a deeper explanatory layer in which their
  structures emerge from a common physical origin. The framework identifies clear
  numerical programs for validation via lattice simulations and delineates the
  conditions under which effective field theories and spacetime descriptions remain valid.
