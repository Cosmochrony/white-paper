\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\label{subsec:context-and-motivation-scope-and-limitations}

The aim of this work is exploratory rather than definitive.
Cosmochrony does not seek to replace established theories within their
empirically validated domains, but to offer a coherent reinterpretation that
may clarify persistent conceptual difficulties concerning time, geometry, and
quantization.
Emphasis is placed on internal consistency, conceptual clarity, and qualitative
contact with observable phenomena, while openly acknowledging open questions
and limitations.
