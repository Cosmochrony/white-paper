\subsection{Relation to Conventional Fields}
\label{subsec:relation-to-conventional-fields}

Effective descriptions derived from projected $\chi$ configurations may
formally resemble scalar or tensor fields used in cosmology and particle
physics.
This resemblance reflects the emergence of a spacetime-based descriptive
language, not the presence of an additional fundamental field.

Energy and quantization are not fundamental attributes of~$\chi$ but arise
at the effective level as consequences of the non-injective projection.
Matter, radiation, and interactions correspond to effective degrees of
freedom arising from structural constraints, spectral organization, and
long-lived relational patterns of projected configurations.
Standard Model fields are recovered as accurate effective descriptions
within the appropriate coarse-grained regimes.

Cosmochrony does not extend the Standard Model by introducing new
fundamental fields.
It provides an ontological explanation for the emergence, applicability, and
structural properties of effective field descriptions themselves.
