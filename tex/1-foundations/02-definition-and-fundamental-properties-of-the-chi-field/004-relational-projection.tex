\subsection{Relational Projection and Spectral Admissibility}
\label{subsec:relational-projection}

Admissible physical descriptions are defined by the spectral properties of
the relational substrate~$\chi$.

\paragraph{Relational operator.}
Let $\mathcal{H}_\chi$ denote the configuration space of admissible
$\chi$ states.
We introduce a relational operator
\begin{equation}
  L_\chi : \mathcal{H}_\chi \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\chi,
\end{equation}
defined purely in terms of $\chi$ correlations.
In discrete implementations (Appendix~D), $L_\chi$ reduces to a graph
Laplacian; in the continuum limit, it defines an effective self-adjoint
operator encoding relational connectivity.

\paragraph{Spectral decomposition.}
The operator $L_\chi$ admits a spectral decomposition
\begin{equation}
  L_\chi \psi_n = \lambda_n \psi_n,
\end{equation}
where $\{\lambda_n\}$ are non-negative eigenvalues and $\{\psi_n\}$ the
associated eigenmodes.

\paragraph{Admissibility as spectral filtering.}
Projectable configurations are selected by a spectral filter acting
on~$L_\chi$.
The infra-physical admissibility projection is
\begin{equation}
  \Pi_{\lambda_*} \;\equiv\;
    f\!\left(\frac{L_\chi}{\lambda_*}\right),
\end{equation}
where $f(x)$ is a fixed, smooth cutoff function satisfying
$f(x)\to 0$ for $x\ll 1$ and $f(x)\to 1$ for $x\gg 1$.
The scale~$\lambda_*$ sets the spectral threshold separating admissible
from non-admissible relational modes.

\paragraph{Non-injectivity of the admissibility projection.}
The projection~$\Pi_{\lambda_*}$ is intrinsically non-injective.
Distinct configurations sharing identical spectral content below the
cutoff~$\lambda_*$ are mapped to the same effective description.
This structural non-injectivity---formalized here at the spectral
level---constrains the class of admissible projected regimes and underpins
the emergence of quantum correlations, internal degrees of freedom, and
measurement processes developed in subsequent sections.
