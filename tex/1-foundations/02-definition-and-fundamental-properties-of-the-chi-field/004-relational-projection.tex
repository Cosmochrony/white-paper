\subsection{Relational Projection and Spectral Admissibility}
  \label{subsec:relational-projection}

  Admissible physical descriptions are defined by the spectral structure
  of the relational substrate~$\chi$, together with compatibility
  constraints imposed by the current effective state~$U$.

  \paragraph{Relational operator.}
    Let $\mathcal{H}_\chi$ denote the configuration space of admissible
    $\chi$ states.
    We introduce a relational operator
    \begin{equation}
      L_\chi : \mathcal{H}_\chi \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\chi,
    \end{equation}
    defined purely in terms of $\chi$ correlations.
    In discrete implementations (Appendix~D), $L_\chi$ reduces to a graph
    Laplacian; in the continuum limit, it defines an effective self-adjoint
    operator encoding relational connectivity.

  \paragraph{Spectral decomposition.}
    The operator $L_\chi$ admits a spectral decomposition
    \begin{equation}
      L_\chi \psi_n = \lambda_n \psi_n,
    \end{equation}
    where $\{\lambda_n\}$ are non-negative eigenvalues and $\{\psi_n\}$ the
    associated eigenmodes.

  \paragraph{Admissibility as constrained spectral filtering.}
    Projectable configurations are selected by a spectral filter acting
    on~$L_\chi$, subject to a compatibility condition with the effective
    state~$U$.
    The infra-physical admissibility operator is defined as a selective
    projection
    \begin{equation}
      \Pi_{\lambda_*}:\mathcal{H}_\chi \rightrightarrows \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{eff}},
      \qquad
      \Pi_{\lambda_*} \;\equiv\;
      f\!\left(\frac{L_\chi}{\lambda_*}\right),
    \end{equation}
    where $f(x)$ is a fixed, smooth cutoff function satisfying
    $f(x)\to 0$ for $x\ll 1$ and $f(x)\to 1$ for $x\gg 1$.
    The scale~$\lambda_*$ sets the spectral threshold separating
    projectively admissible from non-admissible relational modes.
    The correspondence symbol emphasizes that $\Pi_{\lambda_*}$ does not
    define a single-valued map, but selects admissible equivalence classes
    of effective descriptions.

  \paragraph{Non-injectivity and equivalence classes.}
    The projection~$\Pi_{\lambda_*}$ is intrinsically non-injective.
    Distinct relational configurations sharing identical spectral content
    below the cutoff~$\lambda_*$ are identified into the same projected
    equivalence class, provided they remain compatible with the current
    effective state~$U$.
    This structural non-injectivity—formalized here at the spectral
    level—constrains the class of admissible projected regimes and underpins
    the emergence of quantum correlations, internal degrees of freedom, and
    measurement processes developed in subsequent sections.
