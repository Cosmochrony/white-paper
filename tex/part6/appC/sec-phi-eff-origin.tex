\subsection{Substrate Origin of the Effective Galactic Potential}
\label{app:substrate-origin-phi-eff}

Localized excitations influence large scales via a relaxation flux
$\Phi_\chi(r) \sim |\nabla\chi|/K(r)$, where effective stiffness $K(r)$
increases with distance from excitations.
A critical stiffness $K_c$ separates the unsaturated Newtonian regime
($K \ll K_c$) from the saturated non-injective regime
($K \gtrsim K_c$), manifesting as a threshold
$g_N(r) \simeq a_0(t)$.

The cosmological origin is
$a_0(t) \sim c\,H(t)$, predicting slow evolution of the effective
acceleration scale.
In the saturated regime, scale-invariant relaxation flux implies
$g_{\mathrm{eff}} \propto 1/r$ and a logarithmic effective potential
$\Phi_{\mathrm{eff}}(r) \propto \ln r$, directly accounting for flat
rotation curves.
