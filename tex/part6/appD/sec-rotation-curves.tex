\subsection{Galactic Rotation Curves as Tests of Saturation
Dynamics}
\label{subsec:rotation-curve-fits}

Rotation curve data for NGC~3198, NGC~2403, and NGC~5055 are taken
from SPARC-like analyses with fixed distances and inclinations.
The effective acceleration is
\begin{equation}
  g_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)
  = \sqrt{g_N(r)^2 + a_0(t)\,g_N(r)},
\end{equation}
with $a_0(t_0) = \eta\,cH_0$ ($\eta = 0.15$, fixed universally).
The sole free parameter per galaxy is the stellar mass-to-light ratio
$\Upsilon_\star$.
No dark matter halo is introduced.

The hypothesis would be falsified if a single $\Upsilon_\star$ fails
to reproduce inner and outer regions simultaneously, if systematic
overshooting occurs in declining rotation curves, or if flat curves
require galaxy-dependent acceleration scales.
