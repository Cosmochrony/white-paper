% A03 --- Analytical Solutions of the χ-Field Dynamics
\subsection{Analytical Solutions of the
\texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ}-Field Dynamics}
\label{subsec:analytical-solutions}

Explicit solutions of the effective relaxation equation:
\begin{equation}
  \partial_t \chi
  = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{|\nabla \chi|^2}{c^2}}.
  \label{eq:chi_effective_evolution}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Homogeneous relaxation.}
$\nabla\chi = 0$ gives $\partial_t\chi = c$, hence
$\chi(t) = \chi_0 + c\,t$.
This underlies emergent cosmological expansion
(Section~\ref{subsec:homogeneous-cosmological-limit}).

\paragraph{Gradient-saturated profiles.}
Spherically symmetric configurations with $|\partial_r\chi| = c$ satisfy
$\partial_t\chi = 0$ (local freezing), taking the form
$\chi(r) = \chi_0 \pm c\,r$.
These model horizons as boundaries where spacetime notions cease to be
operationally meaningful.

\paragraph{Linear relaxation fronts.}
$\chi(x,t) = \chi_0 + c\,t \pm v\,x$ with $|v| < c$ are exact
solutions describing kinematic boundaries, not propagating waves.

\paragraph{Absence of linear wave solutions.}
Small perturbations do not propagate as oscillatory modes
(Section~\ref{subsec:stability-analysis}).
Apparent wave-like phenomena arise only at the effective level through
collective excitations.
