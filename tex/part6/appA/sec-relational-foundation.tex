\subsection{Relational Foundation and Emergent Geometry}
\label{subsec:relational-foundation-pointer}
\label{app:relational_formulation}

The continuous representation of~$\chi$ used throughout the main text is
a pragmatic approximation, not an ontological commitment.
At a more fundamental level, Cosmochrony can be formulated in purely
relational terms: neither spacetime points, nor distances, nor a metric
are assumed \emph{a priori}.
Temporal ordering arises from monotonic relaxation; spatial relations are
reconstructed from patterns of correlation, resistance, and connectivity
within the~$\chi$ substrate.
The metric appears only as a derived object
(Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-simulation}).
