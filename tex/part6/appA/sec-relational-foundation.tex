\subsection{Relational Foundation and Emergent Geometry}
\label{subsec:relational-foundation-pointer}

The continuous representation of $\chi$ is a pragmatic strategy for
contact with established formalisms, not an ontological commitment.
At a more fundamental level, Cosmochrony can be formulated in purely
relational terms where neither spacetime points, distances, nor a
metric are assumed a~priori.
Temporal ordering arises from monotonic relaxation; spatial relations
are reconstructed operationally from patterns of correlation and
connectivity.
The metric appears only as a derived object.
A concrete realization is developed in
Appendix~\ref{app:relational_formulation}.
