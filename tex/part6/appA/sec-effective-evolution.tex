\subsection{Effective Evolution Equation}
\label{subsec:effective-evolution-equation}

Once a stable geometric description has emerged, large-scale
regularities of admissible projected configurations may be written as
$\Box_{\mathrm{eff}}\chi = S[\chi,\rho]$,
where $\Box_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the d'Alembertian of the emergent
metric and $\rho$ represents the effective density of
relaxation-resistant configurations.
Neither the operator nor the source term is fundamental.

$S[\chi,\rho]$ encodes how localized patterns locally reduce the
admissible relaxation rate.
Gradients in the effective ordering parameter are reinterpreted as
gravitational time dilation and spacetime curvature.

In weak-field regimes,
$S[\chi,\rho] \simeq -\alpha\rho$ with
$\alpha \sim G/c^2$, reproducing the Poisson equation and
Schwarzschild-like solutions.
Nonlinear corrections encode saturation effects inherited from the
kinematic constraint $\partial_t\chi \le c$ and signal the breakdown
of the hydrodynamic approximation.
