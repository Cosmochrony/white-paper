\subsection{Effective Evolution Equation}
\label{subsec:effective-evolution-equation}

Once a stable geometric description has emerged, the ordering relations
between projected~$\chi$ configurations may be written as
\begin{equation}
  \Box_{\mathrm{eff}} \chi = S[\chi,\rho],
\end{equation}
where $\Box_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the d'Alembert operator of the emergent
metric.
Neither the operator nor the source term is fundamental; both arise
through coarse-graining.

In the weak-field approximation,
$S[\chi,\rho] \simeq -\alpha\rho$ with
$\alpha \sim G/c^2$, reproducing the Poisson equation and
Schwarzschild-like solutions.
In strong-field regimes, nonlinear corrections encode saturation effects
from the universal kinematic constraint $\partial_t\chi \leq c$,
marking the limits of validity of the effective spacetime language.
