% A09 --- Energy and Curvature
\subsection{Energy and Curvature}
\label{subsec:energy-and-curvature}

Energy emerges as an effective measure of resistance to global
relaxation.
The diagnostic functional
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{E}_\chi^{\mathrm{eff}}
  \;=\; \frac{1}{2}
  \left[
    (\partial_t \chi)^2 + (\nabla \chi)^2
  \right]
\end{equation}
provides a coarse-grained measure of temporal and spatial deformation.
Regions of large~$\mathcal{E}_\chi^{\mathrm{eff}}$ correspond to strong
internal gradients and are identified with particle-like excitations.

The energetic ordering of atomic orbitals reflects the structural cost of
sustaining increasingly extended and oscillatory $\chi$ configurations.
This is independent of the geometric visibility discussed in
Appendix~\ref{app:level_sets_orbitals}.
Effective spacetime curvature characterizes internal deformation and its
modulation of relaxation propagation; it arises secondarily as a
macroscopic descriptor.
