% A08 --- Relational Foundation and Emergent Geometry
\subsection{Relational Foundation and Emergent Geometry}
\label{subsec:relational-foundation-pointer}

The continuous representation of~$\chi$ is a pragmatic strategy for
contact with established formalisms.
At a more fundamental level, Cosmochrony can be formulated in purely
relational terms, without \emph{a priori} spacetime points, distances,
or metric.
Temporal ordering arises from the monotonic relaxation ordering;
spatial relations are reconstructed from patterns of correlation and
connectivity within~$\chi$.
A concrete realization is developed in
Appendix~\ref{app:relational_formulation}, where the metric appears
only as a derived object encoding relational properties.
