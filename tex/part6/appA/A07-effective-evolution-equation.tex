% A07 --- Effective Evolution Equation
\subsection{Effective Evolution Equation}
\label{subsec:effective-evolution-equation}

Once a stable geometric description has emerged, ordering relations
between projected configurations take the schematic form
$\Box_{\mathrm{eff}} \chi = S[\chi,\rho]$,
where $\Box_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the emergent-metric d'Alembertian and
$\rho$ represents the effective density of relaxation-resistant
configurations.
In the weak-field regime, $S[\chi,\rho] \simeq -\alpha\rho$ with
$\alpha \sim G/c^2$, reproducing the Poisson equation and
Schwarzschild-like solutions.
In strong-field regimes, nonlinear corrections encode saturation effects
imposed by $\partial_t\chi \leq c$ and mark the limits of the
hydrodynamic approximation.
