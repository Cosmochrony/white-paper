\subsection{Structural Origin of Quantum Correlations and
Non-Locality}
\label{app:structural-origin-quantum-correlations}

The non-injective projection $\Pi$ provides a structural
reinterpretation: what appear as two spatially separated particles may
correspond to a single relational configuration in $\chi$.
Entanglement is the manifestation of a single $\chi$-source through
multiple non-injective projective images.
Spin correlations arise from torsional conservation: a local
stabilization at~$A$ structurally constrains admissible projective
states at~$B$ originating from the same source.
Bell inequality violations are attributed to the use of emergent
metric locality in a context where correlations are established prior
to spacetime separation.
The framework remains ontologically realist at the substrate level but
structurally non-local with respect to the emergent spacetime.
