\part{Gravitation and Cosmology}
  \label{part:gravitation-and-cosmology}

  This part addresses gravitation and cosmology as collective, large-scale manifestations of
  substrate relaxation rather than as fundamental interactions.
  Gravitation is shown to arise from the local inhibition of relaxation ordering induced by
  particle excitations, leading to an emergent curvature description consistent with general
  relativity in appropriate regimes.

  Cosmological expansion is interpreted as a global consequence of sustained relaxation,
  without invoking inflation, dark matter particles, or a fundamental dark energy component.
  Observable phenomena such as galactic rotation curves, gravitational lensing, cosmic voids,
  and the Hubble tension are reinterpreted as effective responses to structural saturation and
  projective compensation.

  This part connects the microscopic dynamics of $\chi$ to astrophysical and cosmological
  observables, providing the bridge between foundational principles and large-scale data.
