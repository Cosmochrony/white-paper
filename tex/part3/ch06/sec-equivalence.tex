\subsection{Equivalence Principle}
\label{subsec:equivalence-principle}

All admissible localized projected configurations constrain relaxation
ordering in the same universal manner.
Their internal composition plays no role in how they affect or respond to
the admissible ordering environment.
Inertial resistance and gravitational response are two effective
manifestations of the same underlying constraint, and the equivalence
principle arises as an emergent symmetry of admissible projected
descriptions.
