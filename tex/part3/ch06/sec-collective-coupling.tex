\subsection{Collective Gravitational Coupling and Operational Geometry}
\label{subsec:collective-gravitational-coupling-and-operational-geometry}

The collective reduction of admissible relaxation ordering modulates how
efficiently structural variations can be correlated between different
effective locations.
In regions where projected descriptions are nearly homogeneous, the
effective coupling approaches a uniform value; localized configurations
weaken it by introducing structural constraints.

Spatial separation is defined operationally: two effective regions are
close if structural variations can be efficiently correlated between
them.
In the continuum and weak-constraint regime, this operational notion
admits a compact description in terms of an effective spatial metric
summarizing the collective response to relative variations.
Spacetime curvature emerges as a descriptive manifestation of how
localized configurations modulate collective ordering and correlation
structure.

A more explicit relational construction of the coupling mechanism is
presented in Appendix~\ref{subsec:collective-coupling}.
