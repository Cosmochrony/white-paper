\subsection{Local Slowdown of Relaxation Ordering}
\label{subsec:local-slowdown-of-chi-relaxation}

Gravitation emerges from the collective influence of localized projected
configurations on admissible relaxation ordering.
When particle-like configurations are present in significant number,
their combined effect leads to a macroscopic reduction of the admissible
ordering rate.
In an effective spacetime parametrization, this may be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{eff}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}
  \;\simeq\;
  c \left( 1 - \alpha\, \rho \right),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ denotes the effective density of localized projected
configurations and $\alpha$ encodes their average contribution to
relaxation resistance.
This first-order approximation is valid when localized constraints are
dilute and weakly overlapping.

The coupling parameter~$\alpha$ is emergent and scales as
$\alpha \propto G / c^2$ in terms of effective inertial mass densities.
The collective slowdown manifests as gravitational time dilation and
curvature effects, without introducing any independent gravitational
force or mediator.
