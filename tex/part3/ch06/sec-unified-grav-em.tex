\subsection{Unified Origin of Gravitational and Electromagnetic Effects}
\label{subsec:unified-origin-of-gravitational-and-electromagnetic-effects}

Gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena arise as complementary
effective manifestations of the same relational substrate.
Gravitational effects correspond to sustained, quasi-static constraints on
admissible relaxation ordering induced by persistent localized
configurations.
Electromagnetic phenomena arise from time-dependent, phase-structured
patterns within admissible projected descriptions, admitting an effective
formulation in terms of propagating oscillatory modes.
The familiar distinction between the two interactions emerges at the level
of effective descriptions rather than from fundamentally separate fields.

An explicit derivation of Maxwell-like equations within the Cosmochrony
framework is provided in
Appendix~\ref{app:emergent-electrodynamics}.
