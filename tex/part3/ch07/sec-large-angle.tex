\subsection{Large-Angle Temperature Anomalies}
\label{subsec:large-angle-anomalies}

Large-angle CMB anomalies---low-multipole power suppression and
unexpected large-scale alignments---remain only partially explained within
$\Lambda$CDM~\cite{Planck2018}.
In Cosmochrony, these features are residual relational correlations
inherited from the pre-geometric regime of~$\chi$.

    The Cosmochrony ansatz (green) shows natural suppression of power
    at large angular scales ($\ell < 10$) compared to $\Lambda$CDM
    (dashed orange).}

\subsubsection*{Structural Admissibility and Low-$\ell$ Suppression}
\label{subsec:low-l-admissibility}

The primordial spectrum is modulated by an admissibility filter:
\begin{equation}
  P_{\mathrm{obs}}(k,t)
    = \mathcal{A}^2(k,t)\, P_0(k),
\end{equation}
with a natural phenomenological form
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{A}(k,t)
  = \exp\!\left[-\left(\frac{k_c(t)}{k}\right)^p\right],
\end{equation}
where $k_c(t)$ is the coherence scale associated with the maximal size
of projectively admissible configurations.
For $k \ll k_c(t)$, power suppression arises from the structural
impossibility of supporting such global modes within the available
relational complexity.
The scale~$k_c(t)$ admits a graph-theoretic interpretation through the
spectral gap~$\lambda_2(t)$ of the effective connectivity graph.

\subsubsection*{Testable Predictions}

\paragraph{A. Correlated Suppression Across TT, TE, and EE Spectra.}
The coherence scale~$k_c$ should be consistent across temperature and
polarization spectra.
Future high-precision measurements (e.g.\ \textit{LiteBIRD}) provide a
decisive test.

\paragraph{B. Absence of Primordial Non-Gaussianities.}
The framework predicts an exceptionally small $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$.
A significant detection would falsify this scenario.

\paragraph{C. Scale-Dependent Spectral Tilt Near the Cutoff.}
A mild running of $n_s$ localized near~$k_c$ is expected.
A detailed treatment is provided in
Appendix~\ref{app:lowell_attenuation}.
