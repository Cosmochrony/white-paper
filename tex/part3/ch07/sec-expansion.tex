\subsection{Cosmic Expansion Without Inflation}
\label{subsec:expansion-without-inflation}

Large-scale homogeneity and isotropy reflect the global relational
coherence of the~$\chi$ substrate in the maximally constrained regime,
rather than the outcome of a rapid expansion of spacetime.
Prior to the emergence of a stable geometric projection, notions such as
distance, light cones, and causal disconnection are undefined.
The horizon problem therefore does not arise.

\subsection{Cosmic Expansion as
\texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ} Relaxation}
\label{subsec:expansion-as-relaxation}

Cosmic expansion reflects the progressive relaxation of the relational
substrate~\cite{Friedmann1922}.
As the ordering parameter increases monotonically, projected descriptions
admit an ever broader range of mutually distinguishable relational
configurations.
Expansion is not driven by an external energy component but is an
intrinsic consequence of the relaxation ordering.
Localized matter configurations act as persistent structural constraints,
leading to spatially inhomogeneous unfolding that later manifests as
large-scale structure.
