\subsection{Entropy and the Arrow of Time}
\label{subsec:entropy-arrow}

The arrow of time is a fundamental structural feature arising from the
intrinsic monotonic relaxation ordering of~$\chi$, not a derived
statistical phenomenon.
Entropy increase emerges only at the level of effective spacetime
descriptions, providing a statistical summary of how macroscopic degrees
of freedom evolve under the irreversible relaxation of~$\chi$.
Entropy growth does not explain the arrow of time; it reflects the
underlying temporal asymmetry already present in the substrate.

This reverses the standard explanatory hierarchy: time asymmetry is
imposed intrinsically by the relaxation structure, not attributed to
special initial conditions.
Processes involving deprojection do not correspond to entropy decrease or
temporal reversal but represent a transition to a level of description
where thermodynamic notions no longer apply.
