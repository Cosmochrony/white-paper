\subsection{The Vacuum State as a Minimal Surface}
\label{sec:vacuum-minimal-surface}

In the absence of localized excitations, the projection fiber~$\Pi$
relaxes toward a configuration of minimal spectral tension: the smoothest
admissible projected configuration compatible with global relaxation
constraints.
Geometrically, the vacuum corresponds to a minimal surface in a purely
spectral sense (not a spatial embedding): curvature, torsion, and winding
modes are simultaneously minimized within~$\Pi$.
In this state, the relaxation flow encounters no topological obstruction
and propagates uniformly across the fiber.
Any deviation---localized curvature, torsional distortion, or non-trivial
winding---manifests as the presence of effective fields or particles.

The usual notion of field quantization is replaced by the quantization of
admissible topological modes within a finite-volume projection fiber.
Only a discrete set of deviations from the minimal surface is compatible
with stability and projectability constraints, leading naturally to a
discrete spectrum of excitations.

Vacuum energy is neither divergent nor arbitrary.
It is intrinsically bounded by the spectral cutoff imposed by the
relational graph underlying~$\Pi$.
The finiteness of vacuum energy reflects the finiteness of admissible
spectral deformations of the minimal configuration, rather than the
summation of zero-point energies of independent field modes.
