\subsection{Limitations and Scope}
\label{subsec:limitations-and-scope}

Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} is intentionally minimal.
It constrains admissible projected descriptions in regimes where a stable
geometric interpretation is applicable, but does not provide a
first-principles account of quantum fluctuations or correlations at the
level of~$\chi$ itself.
Such phenomena arise from non-injective projection and coarse-graining.
Higher-order structural effects and strongly non-projectable regimes lie
outside the present scope.

Within these limitations, the constrained ordering relation provides a
unified kinematic backbone from which gravitational, quantum, and
cosmological phenomena can be consistently recovered at the effective level.
More refined treatments of effective fluctuations and extended relational
structures are left for future work.
