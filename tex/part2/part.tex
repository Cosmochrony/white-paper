\part{Dynamics and Particles}
  \label{part:dynamics-and-particles}

  This part develops the effective dynamics of the $\chi$ substrate and explains how
  localized, long-lived excitations emerge as particle-like structures.
  Starting from a parameter-independent relaxation principle, we derive the effective
  equations governing $\chi$ evolution and identify the conditions under which stable
  configurations arise.

  Particles are interpreted not as fundamental entities but as metastable, topologically
  protected patterns of relaxation.
  In this framework, inertial mass, energy--frequency relations, charge, spin, and
  antiparticles emerge as structural and spectral properties of projected $\chi$
  configurations.

  The projection fiber and its transmittance properties are then introduced, providing
  a unified interpretation of gauge structures and internal symmetries.
  This part establishes the physical content of matter and interactions prior to any
  gravitational or quantum interpretation.
