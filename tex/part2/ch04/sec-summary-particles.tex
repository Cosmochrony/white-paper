\subsection{Summary}
\label{subsec:summary-particles}

Particles arise as stable, localized projected configurations that resist
admissible relaxation ordering.
Mass is identified with the degree of effective resistance to $\chi$
relaxation, naturally yielding $E = mc^2$ as a kinematic identity.
Spin and statistical behavior originate from topological obstructions:
fermionic configurations exhibit $4\pi$ periodicity, providing a unified
origin for spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ behavior, fermionic antisymmetry, and the
Pauli exclusion
principle~\cite{Pauli1925,Dirac1928}.
Electric charge is interpreted as a chiral--torsional invariant of the
relaxation flux.
Residual spectral splittings---such as the Lamb shift and hyperfine
structure---arise as finite corrections induced by non-linear saturation
and projectability constraints.
