\subsection{Absence of Dark Energy Signatures}
\label{subsec:absence-of-dark-energy-signatures}

Because cosmic acceleration emerges as a geometric consequence of global
relaxation, no independent dark energy component is introduced.
The framework predicts the absence of signatures associated with
dynamical dark energy: no evolving equation of state, no clustering, no
additional propagating degrees of freedom.
The combined absence of these features, together with suppressed low-$\ell$
CMB power, specific angular correlations, and the absence of an
inflationary tensor imprint at large angular scales, provides a potential
observational discriminator.
