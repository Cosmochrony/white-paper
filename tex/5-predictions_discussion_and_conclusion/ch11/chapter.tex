\section{Testable Predictions and Observational Signatures}
\label{sec:testable-predictions-and-observational-signatures}

Numerical estimates presented below are order-of-magnitude consistency
estimates derived from the geometric coupling between the~$\chi$
substrate and the effective relaxation fraction~$\Omega_\chi$.
Their role is to demonstrate that the framework operates within a
phenomenologically relevant regime.
