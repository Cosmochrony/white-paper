\subsection{Spin and Topological Signatures}
\label{subsec:spin-and-topological-signatures}

If spin originates from topologically nontrivial configurations of~$\chi$
(Section~\ref{subsec:spin_topology}), ultra-high-precision interference
experiments sensitive to $4\pi$ rotational symmetry may probe deviations
associated with the internal topology of localized projectable
configurations.
Such deviations would appear as extremely small phase shifts under closed
$2\pi$ versus $4\pi$ rotational cycles.
These signatures are expected to be strongly suppressed and lie beyond
current experimental resolution.
