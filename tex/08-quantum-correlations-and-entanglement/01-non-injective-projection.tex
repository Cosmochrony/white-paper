\subsection{Non-Injective Projection as the Origin of Quantum Correlations}
  \label{subsec:non-injective-projection}

  The emergence of quantum correlations and entanglement in the Cosmochrony
  framework is rooted in a single structural property of the projection from
  the fundamental $\chi$ substrate to effective physical descriptions:
  this projection is \emph{non-injective}.

  A single admissible configuration of $\chi$ may correspond to multiple
  distinct effective degrees of freedom.
  What appear, at the effective level, as separate particles or subsystems
  are therefore multiple projective manifestations of a single underlying
  ontological configuration.

  This non-injectivity implies that such degrees of freedom cannot be assigned
  independent states.
  Any admissible effective description must be globally consistent with the
  underlying $\chi$ configuration, leading to persistent correlations that
  do not rely on signal exchange, causal influence, or spacetime proximity.
