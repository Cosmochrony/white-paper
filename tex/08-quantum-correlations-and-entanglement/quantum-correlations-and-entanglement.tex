\section{Quantum Phenomena and Entanglement}
  \label{sec:quantum-phenomena-and-entanglement}

  \paragraph{Scope and strategy.}
    This section explains how quantum phenomenology arises as an effective statistical
    description of the projection process in Cosmochrony.
    Building on the \emph{non-injectivity of the projection $\Pi$ established in
Section~\ref{sec:relational_projection}}, we show how entanglement, nonlocal
    correlations, and measurement statistics emerge without introducing additional
    ontological degrees of freedom.

    Distinct underlying $\chi$ configurations may correspond to identical effective
    observables, and a single relational configuration may admit multiple effective
    images depending on the operational context.
    We adopt an \textbf{ontological monism} viewpoint: there is a single ontological
    substrate $\chi$, while apparent multiplicity and spatial separation are properties
    of the projected description.

    Within this setting, so-called ``nonlocality'' does not involve signal transmission.
    Correlated outcomes do not originate from independent ontological subsystems, but
    from a shared underlying relational structure accessed through non-injective
    projection.
