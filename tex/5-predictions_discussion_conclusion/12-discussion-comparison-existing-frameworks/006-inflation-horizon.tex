\subsection{Inflation, Horizon Problems, and Initial Conditions}
\label{subsec:inflation-horizon-problems-and-initial-conditions}

Because~$\chi$ describes a global relaxation process rather than metric
expansion, causal connectivity is not defined in terms of spacetime
lightcones at the fundamental level.
Large-scale coherence arises from initial relational smoothness and
subsequent monotonic relaxation, without requiring an inflationary phase.
The horizon problem is rendered inoperative by the absence of an
initially fragmented causal structure at the pre-geometric level.
A detailed quantitative treatment of primordial perturbations and their
CMB imprint remains an open direction for future work.
