\subsection{Relation to General Relativity}
\label{subsec:relation-to-general-relativity}

Spacetime curvature in Cosmochrony is an emergent descriptive construct
(Section~\ref{subsec:emergent-curvature}).
No \emph{a priori} metric dynamics is postulated; instead, an effective
geometry emerges from variations in local relaxation dynamics.
Matter configurations locally constrain the relaxation of~$\chi$,
leading to differential rates of effective proper-time evolution that are
reinterpreted as effective metric deformations.
In the weak-field regime, Newtonian gravity is reproduced; in the
strong-field limit, Schwarzschild-like solutions emerge.
General Relativity is recovered as the appropriate effective theory
within its empirically validated domain.
