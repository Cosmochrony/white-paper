\subsection{Comparison with
\texorpdfstring{$\Lambda$}{Λ}CDM Cosmology}
\label{subsec:comparison-with-lambdacdm-cosmology}

$\Lambda$CDM introduces cold dark matter, dark energy, and inflation as
effective
postulates~\cite{peebles1993principles,planck2020results}.
In Cosmochrony, cosmic expansion follows from monotonic relaxation of
the substrate, with $H(t) = \dot{\chi}/\chi$ and
$H_0 \sim c/\chi(t_0)$.
Dark energy is reinterpreted as the large-scale relaxation dynamics;
cosmic acceleration reflects cumulative relaxation over cosmological
timescales.
The coincidence problem and the Hubble tension may admit interpretations
in terms of epoch-dependent relaxation dynamics rather than new
fundamental constituents.
Low-$\ell$ CMB suppression is explored as a structural consequence of
relaxation constraints rather than a statistical fluctuation.

Table~\ref{tab:comparison_cosmochrony} summarizes the conceptual
differences between Cosmochrony, $\Lambda$CDM, and Loop Quantum Gravity.
