\subsection{Ontological Parsimony and the Metric}
\label{subsec:ontological-parsimony-and-the-metric}

Cosmochrony achieves genuine ontological simplification rather than
relabeling.
In GR, the metric~$g_{\mu\nu}$ is a fundamental tensor field with ten
independent components; matter and energy are conceptually distinct from
geometry.
In Cosmochrony, only~$\chi$ is fundamental; the metric carries no
independent ontological status; matter, energy, and geometry correspond
to distinct regimes of the same relational structure.

The frameworks are operationally distinct: GR propagates two tensorial
gravitational-wave polarizations from the metric; Cosmochrony has no
independent geometric degrees of freedom.
Singularities signal breakdown of effective geometric descriptions
while~$\chi$ remains well-defined.
Quantization applies only to effective excitations within projectable
regimes, not to~$\chi$
itself~\cite{Rovelli1997}.
\begin{align}
  \text{Standard:} \quad
  & g_{\mu\nu}\;(\text{geometry})
    + \psi\;(\text{matter})
    + \Lambda\;(\text{dark energy}), \\
  \text{Cosmochrony:} \quad
  & \chi\;(\text{single substrate})
    \;\longrightarrow\;
    \{\text{spacetime, matter, expansion}\}.
\end{align}
