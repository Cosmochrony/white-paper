\subsection{Radiation as
\texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ}--Matter Interaction}
\label{subsec:radiation-as-chimatter-interaction}

Radiation arises when a localized, relaxation-resistant configuration
undergoes a transition toward a less constrained state.
The excess relational content ceases to admit a particle-like projected
description and becomes expressible only through delocalized projected
modes.
In effective spacetime descriptions, this redistribution appears as
radiative emission---a transfer of descriptive weight from particle-like
configurations to propagating field-like descriptions, without invoking
discrete objects or stochastic processes.
