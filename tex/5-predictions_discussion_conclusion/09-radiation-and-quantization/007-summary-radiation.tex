\subsection{Summary}
\label{subsec:summary-radiation-quantization}

Radiation and quantization arise from interactions between localized
matter excitations and the~$\chi$ substrate.
Photon-like events emerge only during interaction-induced reprojection.
Quantization reflects geometric and topological constraints of the
relaxation dynamics at the level of projection: discrete energy transfer
occurs when continuous projective descriptions satisfy the conditions
required for localized reprojection.
