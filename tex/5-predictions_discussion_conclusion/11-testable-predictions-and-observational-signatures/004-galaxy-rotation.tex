\subsection{Galaxy Rotation Curves from Structural Relaxation}
\label{subsec:galaxy-rotation-chi}

Persistent relaxation gradients in the $\chi$-substrate modify the
effective inertial response of orbiting matter, producing approximately
flat rotation curves without introducing dark matter components
(Section~\ref{subsec:phi-eff-galaxies}).
Observable consequences include a correlation between rotation curve
flattening and indicators of structural relaxation activity, deviations
from baryonic scaling relations in dynamically young galaxies, and a
reduced need for fine-tuned dark matter profiles in low-surface-brightness
systems.
