\subsection{Gravitational Waves}
\label{subsec:gravitational-waves}

Time-dependent variations in the distribution of localized projected
configurations induce collective and transient modulations of admissible
relaxation ordering.
These modulations propagate at the maximal admissible ordering speed~$c$
and are described, in an effective spacetime language, as gravitational
waves.
Unlike electromagnetic radiation, they represent collective variations of
the admissible ordering and correlation structure itself.

The standard properties---propagation at speed~$c$, transverse
polarization, and energy transport---are recovered as effective features
of collective ordering dynamics.
Gravitational-wave descriptions remain valid only within regimes where
projection onto an effective spacetime remains well defined; in
strong-gravity environments approaching the deprojection threshold
(Section~\ref{subsec:black-hole-deprojection-cycle}), such modulations
may become attenuated or lose a clear spacetime interpretation.
