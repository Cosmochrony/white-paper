\subsection{Summary}
\label{subsec:summary-gravity}

Gravity emerges as a macroscopic consequence of localized projected
configurations collectively constraining admissible relaxation ordering.
Classical gravitational phenomena---time dilation, curvature,
gravitational waves, and black holes---are recovered as distinct
descriptive regimes of this collective constraint.
In extreme regimes, the spectral structure of horizon-associated phenomena
encodes direct information about the relaxation dynamics and projection
topology of the underlying substrate.
