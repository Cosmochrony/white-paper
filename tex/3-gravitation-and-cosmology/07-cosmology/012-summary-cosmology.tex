\subsection{Summary}
\label{subsec:summary-cosmology}

Cosmological phenomena emerge from the global relaxation ordering
of~$\chi$.
Cosmic expansion, large-scale homogeneity, late-time acceleration, and
the arrow of time arise naturally from the relaxation process, without
invoking an inflationary phase, dark energy, or an initial spacetime
singularity.
The Big Bang is a limiting regime of maximal constraint; black holes
represent localized reapproaches to the same descriptive boundary.
At the effective level, the framework reproduces the Hubble law, CMB
structure, and large-scale gravitational behavior as emergent
consequences of a single relational relaxation process.
