\subsection{Historical Admissibility of Projected Degrees of Freedom}
\label{subsec:historical-admissibility}

The set of effective degrees of freedom depends on the admissibility
conditions imposed by the relaxation state.
In the early Universe, only highly coherent, low-complexity global
configurations were admissible.
As relaxation proceeds, the admissible space progressively enlarges,
enabling increasingly localized invariants described as particles,
fields, and interactions.
The particle spectrum is therefore a historically conditioned outcome of
relaxation dynamics, not a timeless feature.
This perspective reconciles the emergence of complexity with monotonic
entropy increase: the early Universe is characterized by both low entropy
and low admissible complexity.
Low-$\ell$ CMB anomalies may be interpreted as relics of this early
regime of restricted admissibility.
