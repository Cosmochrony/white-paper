\subsection{Relation to Quantum Formalism}
\label{subsec:relation-to-quantum-formalism}

Cosmochrony does not treat quantization or wave dynamics as
fundamental~\cite{PeskinSchroeder1995QFT}.
Particles correspond to localized, topologically stable configurations;
discrete observables arise from boundary conditions, topological
constraints, and interaction-induced reprojection.
The Planck relation $E = h\nu$ is a geometric correspondence between
redistributed relaxation potential and minimal projective resolution.
Entanglement reflects a shared, non-factorizable~$\chi$ configuration
persisting only within a finite critical regime of projection, while
decoherence reflects irreversible loss of relational accessibility.
