\subsection{Analogy with Collective Phenomena in QCD}
\label{subsec:analogy-with-collective-phenomena-in-qcd}

A useful structural analogy may be drawn with low-energy
QCD~\cite{Shifman2007QCDVacuum}, where fundamental degrees of freedom
(quarks, gluons) do not appear as isolated entities.
Similarly, Cosmochrony formulates fundamental dynamics solely in terms
of~$\chi$ and its relaxation; observable quantities arise only after
projection into regimes admitting stable effective descriptions.
What appear as elementary constituents at a given effective level may
represent stable, regime-dependent invariants of the underlying
dynamics, in direct analogy with QCD confinement.
