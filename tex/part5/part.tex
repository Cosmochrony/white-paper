\part{Predictions, Discussion, and Conclusion}
  \label{part:predictions-discussion-and-conclusion}

  The final part collects the phenomenological consequences of the Cosmochrony framework
  and confronts them with observation.
  Radiation processes, mass spectra, and quantization are revisited from a unified
  structural perspective, leading to concrete, falsifiable predictions.

  Testable signatures are identified across cosmology, gravitational physics, particle
  spectroscopy, and high-energy regimes, with particular attention to discriminating
  Cosmochrony from $\Lambda$CDM and standard quantum-gravitational extensions.

  The concluding discussion situates Cosmochrony with respect to existing theoretical
  frameworks, clarifies its domain of validity, and highlights open challenges.
  Rather than offering a final theory, this part frames Cosmochrony as a coherent
  pre-geometric program whose value lies in its explanatory unification and predictive
  constraints.
