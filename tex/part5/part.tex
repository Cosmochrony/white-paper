\part{Predictions, Discussion, and Conclusion}
  \label{part:predictions-discussion-and-conclusion}

  This final part collects the phenomenological consequences of the Cosmochrony framework and
  confronts them with observation.
  Radiation processes, mass spectra, and quantization effects are revisited from a unified
  structural perspective, leading to concrete and falsifiable predictions.

  Testable signatures are identified across cosmology, gravitation, particle physics, and
  high-energy regimes, with particular attention to discriminating Cosmochrony from
  $\Lambda$CDM-based models and standard quantum-gravitational extensions.

  The concluding discussion situates Cosmochrony with respect to existing theoretical
  frameworks, clarifies its domain of validity, and highlights open challenges.
  Rather than proposing a final theory, this part frames Cosmochrony as a coherent
  pre-geometric research program constrained by internal consistency and empirical
  accessibility.
