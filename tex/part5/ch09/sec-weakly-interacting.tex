\subsection{Weakly Interacting Radiation}
\label{subsec:weakly-interacting-radiation}

Weakly interacting radiation corresponds to delocalized projective
regimes whose structural contrast is insufficient to efficiently induce
localized reprojection upon encountering matter.
Low-frequency or weakly coupled modes are characterized by smooth, slowly
varying relational structure, strongly suppressing the probability of
stable localized energy transfer.
Small interaction cross sections reflect the low likelihood that a given
projective configuration satisfies the geometric and topological
conditions required for localized reprojection.
