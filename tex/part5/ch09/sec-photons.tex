\subsection{Emergence of Photons}
\label{subsec:emergence-of-photons}

Photons are not fundamental entities.
Prior to emission or detection, no photon exists as an independent
object.
A reconfiguration of relational structure within~$\chi$ ceases to admit
a localized projection and becomes expressible only through extended,
delocalized effective modes---represented in spacetime as electromagnetic
waves.

Photon-like events emerge only at interaction: when a delocalized
projective mode becomes locally constrained by interaction with a
localized excitation, the projection resolves into a discrete transfer of
relaxation capacity.
Quantization is a property of interaction and local reprojection, not of
propagation.
Wave--particle duality reflects a duality of description rather than of
underlying ontology.
Interference phenomena arise from the coherence of delocalized projective
modes; individual detection events correspond to localized reprojections.
