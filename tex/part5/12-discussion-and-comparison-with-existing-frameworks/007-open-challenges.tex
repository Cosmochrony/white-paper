\subsection{Conceptual Implications and Open Challenges}
\label{subsec:conceptual-implications-and-open-challenges}

Temporal ordering arises from the monotonic relaxation of~$\chi$; energy
quantifies residual capacity to resist this relaxation; irreversibility
reflects its progressive exhaustion.
Time, energy, and irreversibility are not independent axioms but
complementary effective descriptions of the same relational dynamics.

Open challenges include the quantitative reconstruction of CMB
anisotropies from early-time $\chi$ dynamics, the detailed treatment of
non-equilibrium decoherence and reprojection, the emergence of gauge
symmetries from topological features, and the long-term stability of
solitonic configurations under extreme conditions.
Progress will require large-scale simulations of $\chi$ dynamics,
discretized lattice realizations, and targeted experimental tests.
