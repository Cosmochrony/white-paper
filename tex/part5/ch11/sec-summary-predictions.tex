\subsection{Summary}
\label{subsec:summary-predictions}

Cosmochrony yields observationally testable signatures spanning
cosmology, gravitation, galactic dynamics, and particle phenomena.
All arise from non-injective projection and structural relaxation.
Predicted deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the percent level include
suppression of low-$\ell$ CMB power, a mild redshift-dependent
modulation of $H(z)$, and coherence-modifying effects in
gravitational-wave propagation near compact objects.
These signatures define a coherent phenomenological pattern from a single
underlying mechanism---the irreversible relaxation and partial
projectability of the $\chi$ substrate.
