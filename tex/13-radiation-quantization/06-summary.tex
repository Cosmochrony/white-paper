\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary-radiation-quantization}

  In Cosmochrony, radiation and quantization arise from interactions between localized
  matter excitations and the $\chi$ substrate.
  Photon-like events emerge only during interaction-induced reprojection, rather than
  corresponding to pre-existing independent entities.

  Quantization reflects geometric and topological constraints of the relaxation
  dynamics of $\chi$ at the level of projection:
  discrete energy transfer occurs when continuous projective descriptions satisfy the
  conditions required for localized reprojection.
  In this sense, quantization is not fundamental discreteness, but an emergent
  manifestation of constrained relaxation and interaction geometry.
