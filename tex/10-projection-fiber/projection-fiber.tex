\section{The Projection Fiber and Gauge Emergence}
  \label{sec:projection-gauge}

  \textit{This section introduces the geometric structure of the projection fiber
    $\Pi$ and shows how gauge interactions emerge as effective symmetries of the
    relaxation flow of the $\chi$ substrate when constrained by projectability and
    topological admissibility.}

  In the Cosmochrony framework, the projection fiber $\Pi$ is not an auxiliary
  mathematical space but a central structural element linking the pre-geometric
  substrate $\chi$ to effective spacetime descriptions.
  It encodes the admissible equivalence classes and internal degrees of freedom
  through which relational configurations of $\chi$ can be consistently projected into
  geometric and field-like representations.

  Gauge interactions do not arise from fundamental interaction fields defined on spacetime.
  They emerge instead as symmetry structures of the projection process itself,
  under local (i.e. descriptively local) re-identification of equivalent representatives along the fiber.
  In this sense, gauge symmetries are not imposed \emph{a priori}, but arise as
  stability conditions of projected descriptions.

  This section develops the geometry of the projection fiber and clarifies how
  distinct classes of gauge phenomena---transmittance (scalar modes), shear-like modes,
  and topological admissibility constraints---naturally emerge from its structure.
