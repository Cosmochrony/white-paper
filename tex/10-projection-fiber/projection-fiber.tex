\section{The Projection Fiber and Gauge Emergence}
  \label{sec:projection-gauge}

  \textit{This section introduces the geometric structure of the projection fiber
    $\Pi$ and shows how gauge interactions emerge as effective symmetries of the
    relaxation flow of the $\chi$ substrate when constrained by projectability and
    topological admissibility.}

  In the Cosmochrony framework, the projection fiber $\Pi$ is not an auxiliary
  mathematical space but a central structural element linking the pre-geometric
  substrate $\chi$ to effective spacetime descriptions.
  It encodes the admissible modes through which relational configurations of
  $\chi$ can be consistently projected into geometric and field-like
  representations.

  Gauge interactions do not arise from fundamental interaction fields defined on
  spacetime.
  They emerge instead as symmetry structures of the projection process itself,
  reflecting the invariance properties of admissible relaxation flows within the
  restricted topology of $\Pi$.
  In this sense, gauge symmetries are not imposed \emph{a priori}, but arise as
  stability conditions of projected descriptions under local re-identification.

  This section develops the geometry of the projection fiber and clarifies how
  distinct classes of gauge phenomena—transmittance, shear, and topological
  constraints—naturally emerge from its structure.
  These constructions provide the geometric basis for the effective gauge sectors
  discussed later in the context of the Standard Model, without introducing
  fundamental gauge fields or additional dynamical degrees of freedom.
