\subsection{Causality and Locality}
  \label{subsec:causality-and-locality}

  Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} is explicitly local and causal.
  The evolution of $\chi$ at any spacetime point depends only on its immediate neighborhood through $\nabla \chi$.

  Importantly, no superluminal propagation occurs at the fundamental level.
  Apparent superluminal recession velocities in cosmology arise from integrating local $\chi$
  increments across extended regions, consistent with relativistic causality.
