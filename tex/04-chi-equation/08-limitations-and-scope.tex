\subsection{Limitations and Scope}
  \label{subsec:limitations-and-scope}

  Equation~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics} is intentionally minimal.
  It does not attempt to describe quantum fluctuations of $\chi$, nor does it incorporate backreaction effects beyond
  first order.

  Its purpose is to provide a unified kinematic backbone from which gravitational, quantum, and cosmological
  phenomena can be derived consistently.

  In the following sections, we apply this dynamical framework to particles, gravity, and entanglement.
