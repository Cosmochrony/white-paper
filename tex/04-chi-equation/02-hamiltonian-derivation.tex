\subsection{Hamiltonian Derivation of the Evolution Equation}
  \label{subsec:hamiltonian-derivation}

  \subsubsection*{Discrete Dynamics of $\chi$}
    Before introducing any metric structure, the dynamics of $\chi$ can be formulated purely in terms of its local
    relaxation on a discrete network.
    Let $\lambda$ be a monotonic ordering parameter, and define the local variation of $\chi$ at node $i$ as:
    \[
      \frac{d \chi_i}{d \lambda} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{c^2} \sum_{j \sim i} K_{ij} (\chi_i - \chi_j)^2}
      \label{eq:discrete-dynamics}
    \]
    Here, $K_{ij}$ is the connectivity strength between nodes $i$ and $j$ (introduced in
    Section~\ref{subsec:the-geometric-effective-action-and-lagrangians-of-cosmochrony-Lcc}), and the sum runs over
    neighboring nodes $j$.
    This equation is \textbf{metric-independent} and defines the fundamental dynamics of $\chi$ in terms of its local
    correlations.

  \subsubsection*{Continuum Limit}
    In the limit where the network becomes dense (i.e., the distance between nodes approaches zero), the discrete sum
    can be approximated by a continuous Laplacian:
    \[
      \sum_{j \sim i} K_{ij} (\chi_i - \chi_j)^2 \approx \int |\nabla \chi|^2 \, dV
    \]
    This yields the effective evolution equation in the continuum:
    \[
      \partial_t \chi = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{|\nabla \chi|^2}{c^2}}
    \]
    where $\nabla$ is now defined with respect to the emergent metric $g_{\mu\nu}$, derived from the network's
    connectivity (see Section~\ref{subsec:the-geometric-effective-action-and-lagrangians-of-cosmochrony-Lcc}).

  \subsubsection*{Hamiltonian Constraint}
    While the dynamics of $\chi$ can be viewed as a minimal relaxation principle, it can be more rigorously derived from
    a Hamiltonian constraint.
    We postulate that the dynamics of $\chi$ are governed by a Dirac-type kinematic constraint in phase space, analogous
    to the mass-shell condition for a massless relativistic particle:
    \[
      (\partial_t \chi)^2 + |\nabla \chi|^2 = c^2
      \label{eq:hamiltonian_constraint}
    \]
    where $c$ is the fundamental velocity scale.
    Combined with the arrow of time postulate ($\partial_t \chi \geq 0$), which reflects the irreversible relaxation of
    the Cosmochron, this leads uniquely to the first-order evolution equation:
    \[
      \partial_t \chi = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{|\nabla \chi|^2}{c^2}}
      \label{eq:chi_dynamics}
    \]
    This derivation grounds the ``minimal principle'' in the symplectic structure of the field's phase space, ensuring
    that $\chi$ acts as an intrinsic time coordinate.
