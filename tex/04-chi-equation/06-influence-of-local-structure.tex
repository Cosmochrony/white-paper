\subsection{Influence of Local Structure}
  \label{subsec:influence-of-local-structure}

  In regions where $\nabla \chi \neq 0$, the effective rate of $\chi$-relaxation is reduced.
  This slowing plays a central role in the emergence of gravitational phenomena.

  Localized excitations---identified with particles---act as topological or dynamical constraints on $\chi$,
  increasing $|\nabla \chi|$ and thereby locally reducing $\partial_t \chi$.

  This mechanism leads naturally to time dilation and spatial curvature without invoking an independent
  gravitational field.
