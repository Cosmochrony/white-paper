\subsection{Relation to Quantum Formalism}
    \label{subsec:relation-to-quantum-formalism}

  Quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (QFT) introduce probabilistic wavefunctions, operators, and
  quantization rules as foundational postulates~\cite{PeskinSchroeder1995QFT}.
    In contrast, Cosmochrony treats wave behavior as primary and quantization as emergent.

  In this framework, particles correspond to localized, topologically stable wave configurations (soliton-like
  excitations) of $\chi$.
    Quantized observables arise from boundary conditions, topological constraints, and interaction-induced mode
  selection rather than from intrinsic discreteness.
  The Planck relation $E = h\nu$ is interpreted as a geometric correspondence between frequency, curvature, and energetic
    cost of local field deformation.

  Entanglement is described as the persistence of a shared wave configuration across spatial separation, while
  decoherence corresponds to the irreversible fragmentation of this configuration due to interactions with the
  surrounding $\chi$ field.
  This interpretation reproduces standard quantum predictions while avoiding nonlocal signaling or
  collapse postulates.
