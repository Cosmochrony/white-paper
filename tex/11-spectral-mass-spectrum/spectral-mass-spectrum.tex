\section{Spectral Mass Spectrum and Hierarchy}
  \label{sec:spectral-mass-hierarchy}

  \textit{This chapter establishes that mass is neither an intrinsic property nor a
  coupling to an external field, but a spectral invariant arising from the dynamical
  frustration between relaxation flows and topological constraints on the projection
  fiber $\Pi$, and that observed mass hierarchies reflect the ordered structure of
  these spectral constraints rather than independent physical parameters.}
