\subsection{Relation to the Effective Geometric Description}
  \label{subsec:relation-to-the-effective-geometric-description}

  The effective geometric structures introduced in the main text—such as metric
  fields, spatial gradients, connection-like objects, and Poisson-type
  equations—do not represent fundamental degrees of freedom in Cosmochrony.
  They arise as coarse-grained summaries of relational configurations of the
  \(\chi\) field once a projectable regime becomes applicable.
