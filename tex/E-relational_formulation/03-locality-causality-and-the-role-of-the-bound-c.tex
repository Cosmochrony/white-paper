\subsection{Locality, Causality, and the Role of the Bound \texorpdfstring{$c$}{c}}
  \label{subsec:locality-causality-and-the-role-of-the-bound-c}

  Within the relational formulation of Cosmochrony, correlations between
  configurations of the \(\chi\) field may extend across arbitrarily large effective
  distances once a geometric description becomes applicable.
  However, the existence of such correlations does not imply unrestricted dynamical
  influence.
  All modifications of relational configurations are constrained by a universal
  kinematic bound, denoted by \(c\).
