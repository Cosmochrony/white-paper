\subsection{Nonlocality and the Holistic Character of Projected
Descriptions}
\label{subsec:nonlocality-and-holistic-nature}

Quantum nonlocality does not arise from superluminal interactions but
reflects the intrinsically non-factorizable character of certain
admissible projected descriptions~\cite{Bell1964}.
Entangled systems correspond to single projected configurations that
cannot be decomposed into independent subsystems without loss of
admissibility.

\subsection{Nonlocal Correlations Without Superluminality}
\label{subsec:nonlocal-correlations-without-superluminality}

Correlated outcomes arise because spacelike separated measurements
correspond to different local reprojections of a single non-factorizable
description.
The factorization assumptions underlying Bell-type inequalities are
violated, while dynamical locality and relativistic causality remain
intact (see
Appendix~\ref{subsec:non-factorization-entanglement}).
The correlations are \emph{ontological}---fixed by the non-injective
global relational structure---rather than \emph{dynamical}.

\subsection{Temporal Ordering and Relativistic Consistency}
\label{subsec:temporal-ordering-and-relativistic-consistency}

Temporal ordering arises only at the effective level.
Different observers may assign different orderings to spacelike separated
events; such differences reflect observer-dependence of spacetime slicing
and have no impact on the relational consistency of admissible
descriptions.
Relativistic covariance is preserved by the invariance of the underlying
non-injective relational configuration across all admissible projected
descriptions.
