\part{Quantum Mechanics}
  \label{part:quantum-mechanics}

  This part presents a unified treatment of quantum phenomena as consequences of
  non-injective projection rather than as fundamental departures from classical logic.
  Quantum correlations, indeterminacy, and entanglement are derived from the structural
  non-factorizability of projected $\chi$ descriptions.

  Bell inequality violations are interpreted as signatures of ontological projection
  failure, not as evidence of superluminal influences.
  Measurement, decoherence, and apparent wave-function collapse are described as
  context-dependent stabilization processes within projected regimes.

  The relation to the standard quantum formalism is clarified, including the emergence
  of Hilbert space structure, effective Schr\"odinger dynamics, and the Born rule.
  This part situates quantum mechanics as an effective and internally consistent
  descriptive framework arising from deeper relational constraints.
