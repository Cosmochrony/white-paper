\part{Quantum Mechanics}
  \label{part:quantum-mechanics}

  This part presents a unified treatment of quantum phenomena as consequences of non-injective
  projection rather than as fundamental departures from classical logic.
  Quantum correlations, indeterminacy, and entanglement are derived from the structural
  non-factorizability of projected $\chi$ descriptions.

  Violations of Bell inequalities are interpreted as signatures of ontological projection
  failure, not as evidence of superluminal influences.
  Measurement, decoherence, and apparent wave-function collapse are described as
  context-dependent stabilization processes within projected regimes.

  The relation to the standard quantum formalism is clarified, including the emergence of
  Hilbert space structure, effective Schr\"odinger dynamics, and the Born rule.
  Quantum mechanics is thus situated as a consistent and predictive effective framework
  arising from deeper relational constraints.
