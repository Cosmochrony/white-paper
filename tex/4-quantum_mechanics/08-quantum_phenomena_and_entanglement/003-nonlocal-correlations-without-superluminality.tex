\subsection{Nonlocal Correlations Without Superluminality}
\label{subsec:nonlocal-correlations-without-superluminality}

Correlated outcomes arise because spacelike separated measurements
correspond to different local reprojections of a single non-factorizable
description.
The factorization assumptions underlying Bell-type inequalities are
violated, while dynamical locality and relativistic causality remain
intact (see
Appendix~\ref{subsec:non-factorization-entanglement}).
The correlations are \emph{ontological}---fixed by the non-injective
global relational structure---rather than \emph{dynamical}.

Attosecond-resolved measurements have demonstrated that quantum
correlations become experimentally accessible on timescales far shorter
than any interaction-based
mechanism~\cite{PhysRevLett.133.163201}.
Within Cosmochrony, the observed timescale corresponds to the resolution
time of the effective projection~$\Pi$, not to a physical propagation
time: it probes projective accessibility rather than dynamical formation
of correlations.
