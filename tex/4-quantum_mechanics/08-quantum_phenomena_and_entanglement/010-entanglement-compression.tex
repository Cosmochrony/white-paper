\subsection{Implications for Quantum Computation}
\label{subsec:implications-quantum-computation}

Effective resources exploited in quantum computation may be reinterpreted
as manifestations of structural non-injectivity and global consistency
constraints.
Multiple underlying relational configurations may correspond to the same
effective observable state, providing a natural origin for effective
parallelism without explicit information exchange.
Part of the computational advantage may reflect general properties of
non-factorizable descriptive mappings rather than exclusively quantum
dynamical effects.
