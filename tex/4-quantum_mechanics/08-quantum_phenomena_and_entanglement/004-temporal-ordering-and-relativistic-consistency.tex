\subsection{Temporal Ordering and Relativistic Consistency}
\label{subsec:temporal-ordering-and-relativistic-consistency}

Temporal ordering arises only at the effective level.
Different observers may assign different orderings to spacelike separated
events; such differences reflect observer-dependence of spacetime slicing
and have no impact on the relational consistency of admissible descriptions.
Relativistic covariance is preserved by the invariance of the underlying
non-injective relational configuration across all admissible projected descriptions.
