\subsection{Entanglement as a Critical Regime of Projective Compression}
\label{subsec:entanglement-critical-compression}

Quantum entanglement arises as a structural consequence of the non-injective
projection $\Pi:\chi \rightarrow \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.
The projection reduces a high-dimensional relational configuration to a
lower-dimensional effective description; the resulting fiber $\Pi^{-1}(\chi_{\mathrm{eff}})$ constitutes an
  information-theoretic channel whose bandwidth depends on unresolved modes of~$\chi$.

Non-factorizable correlations emerge only in an intermediate
\emph{critical} regime of projective compression: the effective
description is sufficiently coarse-grained to permit subsystem
identification, yet retains enough global relational structure to prevent full factorization.
Increased compression (environmental coupling, decoherence) suppresses
correlations, yielding classical behavior; decreased compression breaks subsystem separation.
The critical regime may be intermittent, with correlations appearing
during specific spectral reconfiguration events (Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-simulation}).
