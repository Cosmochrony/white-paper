\subsection{Limits of Entanglement and Environmental Effects}
\label{subsec:limits-of-entanglement}

Entanglement arises only within restricted regimes in which a
non-factorizable global description remains jointly projectable.
Environmental coupling progressively restricts the set of admissible
projected descriptions to locally stable, approximately factorizable regimes.
Entanglement is most robust for effectively isolated systems and becomes
increasingly fragile in macroscopic environments.
Classical behavior emerges when only factorized projected descriptions
remain admissible, without requiring any modification of the underlying relational structure.
