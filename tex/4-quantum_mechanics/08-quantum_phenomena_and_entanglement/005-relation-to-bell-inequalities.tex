\subsection{Relation to Bell Inequalities}
\label{subsec:relation-to-bell-inequalities}

Bell's theorem~\cite{Bell1964} rules out any ontological completion of
quantum mechanics based on factorizable hidden-variable models.
Cosmochrony fully accepts Bell's theorem and identifies the ontological
assumption that fails: the factorization hypothesis $P(a,b|x,y,\lambda) = P(a|x,\lambda)\,P(b|y,\lambda)$.

Because the projection~$\Pi$ is generically non-injective, admissible
projected states are not associated with independent ontic pre-images for their subsystems.
The factorization hypothesis is not merely violated but \emph{ill-defined}
within the space of admissible projected descriptions.

Bell-type violations arise in an intermediate regime of projective
compression: the effective description is sufficiently coarse-grained to
permit subsystem separation, yet retains enough global relational structure to prevent factorization.
In the limit of extreme coarse-graining, projected descriptions become effectively classical.

No hidden variables and no superluminal influence are introduced.
Quantum nonlocality is ontological rather than dynamical: the failure of
Bell-type factorizability arises from the structure of admissible projected descriptions, not from nonlocal interaction.
