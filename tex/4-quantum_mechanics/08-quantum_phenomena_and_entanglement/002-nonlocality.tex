\subsection{Nonlocality and the Holistic Character of Projected Descriptions}
\label{subsec:nonlocality-and-holistic-nature}

Quantum nonlocality does not arise from superluminal interactions but
reflects the intrinsically non-factorizable character of certain admissible projected descriptions~\cite{Bell1964}.
Entangled systems correspond to single projected configurations that
cannot be decomposed into independent subsystems without loss of admissibility.
