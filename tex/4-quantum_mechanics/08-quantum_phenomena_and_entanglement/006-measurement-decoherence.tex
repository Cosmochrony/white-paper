\subsection{Measurement, Decoherence, and Apparent Collapse}
\label{subsec:measurement-and-decoherence}

Quantum measurement does not involve fundamental wavefunction collapse.
Measurement corresponds to the transition from a non-factorizable
admissible projected description to a set of effectively factorized local projections.
Decoherence suppresses interference between incompatible descriptive
branches by rendering their relative phase information inaccessible
within spacetime representations~\cite{Zurek2003}.
The underlying relational structure remains globally well defined.
The apparent collapse is the effective manifestation of a non-injective
relational structure becoming only partially projectable into spacetime.
