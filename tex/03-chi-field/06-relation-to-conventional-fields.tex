\subsection{Relation to Conventional Fields}
\label{subsec:relation-to-conventional-fields}

Although $\chi$ shares mathematical similarities with scalar fields used in cosmology (e.g., inflaton-like fields),
its role is fundamentally different.
It does not carry energy in the conventional sense, nor does it require quantization at the fundamental level.

Matter, radiation, and interactions emerge as localized excitations, constraints, or topological features of $\chi$,
rather than as independent entities coupled to it.
