\section{Definition and Fundamental Properties of the $\chi$ Field}
  \label{sec:definition-and-fundamental-properties-of-the-chi-field}

  Having outlined the ontological and conceptual principles underlying Cosmochrony, we now
introduce the fundamental quantity at the core of the framework.
This section is devoted to defining the scalar entity $\chi$ and clarifying its role as a
pre-geometric substrate from which spacetime notions, dynamical laws, and physical observables
emerge.

The purpose of this section is not to assume a pre-existing spacetime structure, but to
establish the minimal properties required of $\chi$ in order to recover, in appropriate
regimes, effective notions of time, space, metric geometry, and field dynamics.
Accordingly, $\chi$ is introduced independently of any spacetime coordinates or metric,
and only later related to effective geometric descriptions once a stable regime is reached.

In this sense, the use of variational, Lagrangian, or metric-based formulations later in this
section does not imply that spacetime or a four-dimensional manifold is fundamental.
These formalisms are employed as effective tools to describe the dynamics of $\chi$ in regimes where
a spacetime interpretation becomes meaningful, and should be understood as emergent,
coarse-grained representations of the underlying pre-geometric dynamics.

We begin by providing a unified conceptual definition of the $\chi$ field and its physical
interpretation.
Subsequent subsections introduce effective dynamical descriptions---including Lagrangian and
metric formulations---that are intended as coarse-grained representations valid when the
underlying $\chi$ configurations admit a spacetime interpretation.
