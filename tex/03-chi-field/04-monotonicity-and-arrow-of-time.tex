\subsection{Monotonicity and Arrow of Time}
\label{subsec:monotonicity-and-arrow-of-time}

A fundamental postulate of the theory is that $\chi$ evolves monotonically\cite{Prigogine1997,Penrose1989Weyl}:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \chi}{\partial t} \ge 0 .
\end{equation}

This monotonicity is not derived from statistical considerations but is taken as a primitive geometric property.
It provides a natural origin for the arrow of time and ensures global causal ordering without invoking special
boundary conditions.

Irreversibility arises because any decrease of $\chi$ would correspond to a contraction of both temporal and spatial
structure, which is dynamically forbidden within the theory.
