\subsection{Physical Interpretation}
\label{subsec:physical-interpretation}

The central interpretative assumption of Cosmochrony is that spacetime is not a static background but the
macroscopic manifestation of the continuous relaxation of $\chi$.
An increase in $\chi$ corresponds simultaneously to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the passage of local proper time,
  \item the emergence of spatial distance between causally connected events,
  \item the global expansion of the universe when integrated over large scales.
\end{itemize}

In this framework, distance may be interpreted as ``frozen time,'' while time corresponds to ``locally thawed
distance.''
This dual interpretation is not imposed ad hoc but follows from the identification of both quantities with the
same underlying field.
