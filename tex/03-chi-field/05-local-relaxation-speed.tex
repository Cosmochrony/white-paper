\subsection{Local Relaxation Speed}
\label{subsec:local-relaxation-speed}

The local rate of change of $\chi$ is bounded by a universal constant:
\begin{equation}
  \left| \nabla_\mu \chi \right| \le c ,
\end{equation}
where $c$ coincides with the observed speed of light.

This bound does not represent the propagation speed of particles or signals, but the maximal rate at which
spacetime itself can locally unfold.
Superluminal recession velocities at cosmological scales arise naturally through cumulative effects and do not
violate local causality.
