\subsection{Initial Conditions and Global Structure}
\label{subsec:initial-conditions-and-global-structure}

The theory assumes an initial condition characterized by a minimal value $\chi_0$, naturally associated with the Planck
scale.
Cosmic evolution corresponds to the progressive relaxation of $\chi$ from this initial state.

Importantly, the framework does not require a spacetime singularity in the traditional sense.
Instead, the apparent singular behavior arises from extrapolating classical notions of time and distance beyond the
domain where $\chi$ is well-defined.

In the next section, we derive a minimal dynamical equation governing the evolution of $\chi$ and explore its immediate
consequences.
