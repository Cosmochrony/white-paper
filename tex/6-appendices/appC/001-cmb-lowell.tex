\subsection{Low-\texorpdfstring{$\ell$}{ℓ} CMB Power Suppression
from Global \texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ} Relaxation}
\label{app:lowell_attenuation}

The lowest CMB multipoles probe global properties of
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rather than independent local perturbations
(Sections~\ref{subsec:cmb},~\ref{subsec:large-angle-anomalies}).
Because the finite relaxation capacity of~$\chi$ limits how globally
coherent configurations can deviate from the relaxed background, the
lowest $\ell$-modes are systematically attenuated.

  \paragraph{Significance of the unsmoothed comparison.}
    Figure~\ref{fig:cmb_lowell_unsmoothed} is not intended as a precision fit,
    but as a structural diagnostic.
    Unlike a sharp infrared cutoff or a purely statistical suppression,
    the attenuation mechanism preserves the relative multipole-to-multipole
    variations observed in the Planck data.
    As $\ell \rightarrow 0$, the same increasing and decreasing trends are
    reproduced, albeit with a progressively reduced amplitude.

    This behavior is non-trivial.
    In $\Lambda$CDM, the lowest multipoles are treated as cosmic-variance–dominated
    outliers, with no underlying mechanism constraining their relative structure.
    Here, the correlated attenuation emerges from a single global constraint:
    the finite relational coherence capacity of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.

  \paragraph{Phenomenological parametrization.}
\begin{equation}
  C_\ell^{\mathrm{CC}}
  = C_\ell^{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}
    \left[
      1 - \alpha
        \exp\!\left(-\frac{\ell}{\ell_0}\right)
    \right],
  \quad
  \alpha \in [0,1],\;\ell_0 > 0.
  \label{eq:cc_lowell_envelope}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Graph-theoretic admissibility filter.}
The weighted Laplacian $L_G(t)$ of the relational connectivity graph
sets a minimal nonzero eigenvalue $\lambda_2(t)$ characterizing global
connectivity.
The primordial power spectrum is modulated by
\[
  \mathcal{A}(k,t)
  = \exp\!\left[
      -\left(
        \frac{\lambda_2(t)}{k^2}
      \right)^{\!p/2}
    \right],
\]
reflecting the inability of an insufficiently connected relational graph
to support large-scale coherent modes.
