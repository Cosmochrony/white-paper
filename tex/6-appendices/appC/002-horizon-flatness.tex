\subsection{Resolution of the Horizon and Flatness Problems Without
Inflation}
\label{subsec:cosmochrony_horizon_flatness}

\paragraph{Horizon problem: pre-geometric connectivity.}
Large-scale correlations originate from the global connectivity of~$\chi$
prior to the emergence of any effective spacetime description.
Regions that later appear causally disconnected share correlated
configurations inherited from earlier relaxation phases.

\paragraph{Flatness problem: relaxation toward geometric uniformity.}
Effective spatial curvature reflects large-scale gradients in the
relaxation rate of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.
Configurations with large curvature gradients are dynamically
disfavored, so near-flat spatial geometry emerges as a natural
attractor of the relaxation dynamics, without exponential expansion or
fine-tuning.

\paragraph{Implications for primordial correlations.}
Because large-scale coherence arises from global organization of~$\chi$
rather than amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations, exact
scale invariance is not expected at the largest wavelengths.
Deviations at the lowest CMB multipoles motivate the analysis in
Section~\ref{app:lowell_attenuation}.
