\subsection{Cosmological Role of Neutrino-Like Excitations}
\label{subsec:cosmological-role-of-neutrino-like-excitations}

Neutrino-like excitations occupy an intermediate regime between
particle-like solitons and radiative modes, with minimal structural
energy and weak localization.
Their free streaming implements a non-local relaxation channel that
transports residual structural mismatch without efficient
thermalization.
This suppresses growth of small-scale projected structures and
contributes to the emergence of a cosmological arrow of time as an
ordering of admissible projected configurations.

\subsection{Neutrino-Mediated Structural Smoothing and
Cosmological Inference}
\label{subsec:neutrino-mediated-structural-smoothing-and-cosmological-inference}

The effective Hubble rate encodes both geometric expansion and
cumulative structural relaxation.
Early-time observables (CMB anisotropies) are sensitive to the
integrated neutrino-mediated smoothing; parameter inference assuming
purely geometric expansion may systematically underestimate the
late-time expansion rate.
The lowest CMB multipoles may reflect anisotropic relaxation during the
neutrino-dominated smoothing phase.
