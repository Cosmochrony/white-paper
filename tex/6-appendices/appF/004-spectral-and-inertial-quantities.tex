  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$\lambda_n$}{λn} (Spectral eigenvalues).}
    Eigenvalues of the linearized relaxation or stability operator acting on small
    perturbations of a localized $\chi$ configuration.
    They determine inertial mass scales in the effective description.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$\psi_n$}{ψn} (Spectral modes).}
    Eigenmodes associated with the operator $\Delta_G$.
    They encode the internal structure and stability of particle-like configurations.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$m_{\mathrm{eff}}$}{meff} (Effective mass).}
    An emergent invariant determined by the spectral stability of localized
    $\chi$ configurations under projection.
    Operationally, effective mass measures the self-consistency overhead
    associated with maintaining a coherent projected description under
    local updates.
    Mass is not a fundamental parameter nor a coupling constant.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$Q$}{Q} (Topological charge).}
    An integer-valued invariant characterizing the topology of a stable
    $\chi$ configuration.
    Different values of $Q$ correspond to distinct particle families.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$\Omega^\pm$}{Ω±} (Chiral topological sectors).}
    Opposite chiral configurations of topological $\chi$ structures.
    They are related by orientation reversal and need not be energetically equivalent.
