  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$a_{\star}$}{a★} (Operational saturation threshold).}
    An effective acceleration proxy marking the onset of saturated
    response in the projected description.
    It scales inversely with the local descriptive resolution $\ell$
    according to
    \[
      a_{\star} \sim \kappa \frac{b_{\chi}}{\ell},
    \]
    where $\kappa$ is a dimensionless normalization factor.
    $a_{\star}$ is not a fundamental constant but a regime-dependent
    manifestation of the invariant transport bound $b_{\chi}$.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$b_{\chi}$}{bχ} (Invariant relaxation bound).}
    The fundamental bound on admissible relaxation transport within the
    $\chi$ substrate.
    It limits the maximal rate at which relational configurations can be
    updated while preserving operational closure under projection.
    All effective saturation phenomena are manifestations of this invariant
    bound under different dimensional projections.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$c$}{c} (Effective speed of light).}
    The maximal signal propagation speed in emergent spacetime.
    $c$ is not fundamental: it is the geometric projection of the
    substrate transport bound $b_{\chi}$ through the relaxation speed
    $c_{\chi}$ in projectable regimes.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$\hbar$}{ℏ} (Effective Planck constant).}
    An emergent quantum of action associated with projection thresholds and spectral
    granularity.
    It is not fundamental at the level of $\chi$.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$G$}{G} (Newtonian gravitational constant).}
    An emergent coupling constant arising from large-scale collective relaxation
    dynamics of $\chi$.
    Its value reflects structural properties rather than fundamental interaction
    strengths.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}$}{Λeff} (Effective cosmological constant).}
    A residual large-scale relaxation effect associated with incomplete equilibration
    of the $\chi$ substrate.
