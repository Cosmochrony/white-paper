\subsection{Relaxation Network and Operators}
  \label{subsec:relaxation-network-and-operators}

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$G(V,E)$}{G(V,E)} (Relaxation network).}
    A discrete graph representing the underlying relational structure on which the
    $\chi$ substrate is defined.
    Vertices correspond to elementary degrees of freedom and edges encode relaxation
    couplings.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$K_{ij}$}{Kij} (Relaxation coupling).}
    Edge-dependent coupling coefficients defined on the relaxation network.
    They quantify the resistance to relative variations of $\chi$ between
    neighboring nodes and encode geometric and topological information.
    $K_{ij}$ are structural parameters of the pre-geometric substrate and do not
    represent dynamical interaction constants.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$\Delta_G$}{ΔG} (Graph Laplacian / relaxation operator).}
    The discrete Laplace--Beltrami operator associated with the network $G(V,E)$ and
    the couplings $K_{ij}$.
    Its spectral properties govern the stability, localization, and inertial
    behavior of $\chi$ configurations.

  \paragraph{\texorpdfstring{$D_{\mathrm{loc}}\chi$}{Dlocχ} (Local relaxation operator).}
    A local relational operator governing the evolution of $\chi$ at the microscopic
    level.
    It replaces differential operators defined on continuous manifolds.
