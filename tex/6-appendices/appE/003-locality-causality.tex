\label{subsec:locality-causality-and-the-role-of-the-bound-c}

Correlations between configurations of~$\chi$ may extend across
arbitrarily large effective distances once a geometric description
applies.
However, all modifications of relational configurations are constrained
by a universal kinematic bound~$c$.
