\subsection{CP Asymmetry and Chiral Selection}
\label{subsec:cp-asymmetry-and-chiral-selection}

CP acts on a subset of invariants $\{Q_i\}$ without reversing the
ordering parameter, so it is not generally an admissibility invariance.
Effective CP violation may arise without violating CPT.

If the stabilization rate satisfies $\Gamma(Q) \neq \Gamma(-Q)$, one orientation is statistically
favored during relaxation, producing matter--antimatter asymmetry
without explicit fundamental symmetry breaking.

Neutrino-like excitations correspond to minimally constrained
configurations admissible in only one chiral sector; configurations of
opposite chirality fail to localize or decay rapidly.
