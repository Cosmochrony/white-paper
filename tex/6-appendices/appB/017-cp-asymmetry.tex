\subsection{CP Asymmetry and Chiral Selection}
  \label{subsec:cp-asymmetry-and-chiral-selection}

  \subsubsection*{CPT versus CP as Admissibility Symmetries}

    Let projected configurations carry a set of signed structural invariants
    \(\{Q_i\}\), associated with orientation, chirality, or phase winding.
    The admissibility conditions are invariant under the combined transformation
    \[
      (Q_i,\;\tau,\;\mathbf{x}) \rightarrow (-Q_i,\;-\tau,\;-\mathbf{x}),
    \]
    which defines an effective CPT symmetry at the level of the projected description.

    In contrast, CP acts only on a subset of the invariants \(\{Q_i\}\)
    and does not reverse the effective ordering parameter.
    CP is therefore not, in general, an invariance of admissibility.
    Effective CP violation may arise without violating CPT invariance,
    reflecting a structural asymmetry of the projection
    rather than a breakdown of the relational substrate.

  \subsubsection*{Structural Bias and Statistical Asymmetry}

    Assume that admissible projected configurations exhibit a slight asymmetry in
    relaxation efficiency with respect to the sign of a structural invariant \(Q\).
    Let \(\Gamma(Q)\) denote the effective stabilization rate.

    If
    \[
      \Gamma(Q) \neq \Gamma(-Q),
    \]
    then configurations carrying one orientation are statistically favored during
    relaxation.
    Matter–antimatter asymmetry may therefore emerge as a dynamical bias in the
    projective selection process, without requiring explicit symmetry breaking
    at the fundamental level.

    This statistical asymmetry provides the ontological background
    within which the more specific spectral structure of flavor mixing,
    developed in Section~\ref{subsec:flavor-structure-cp},
    can operate.

  \subsubsection*{Chiral Filtering and Neutrino-Like Excitations}

    Weakly localized projected configurations carrying a chiral invariant
    may be admissible only in one orientation sector.
    Configurations of opposite chirality either fail to localize or decay rapidly.

    Neutrino-like excitations correspond to such minimally constrained modes,
    which remain admissible only in one chiral sector and interact weakly
    with more structured excitations.
