\subsection{Soliton and Particle Solutions}
\label{subsec:soliton-and-particle-solutions}

Elementary particles are stable localized configurations arising in
the projectable regime.
While the fundamental field is scalar, certain configurations possess
nontrivial internal organization requiring a double-valued
representation under effective rotations.
The Dirac equation appears as the minimal effective dynamics compatible
with approximate locality, relativistic covariance, and
$4\pi$-periodic topology.
Spin, fermionic statistics, and exclusion behavior arise as
consequences of the nontrivial configuration space.
The effective self-interaction functional must support localized
configurations with finite mass, dynamical stability, and
topologically inequivalent sectors.
