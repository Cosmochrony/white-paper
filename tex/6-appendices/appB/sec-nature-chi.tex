\subsection{Interpretative Status of the
\texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ} Field}
\label{subsec:nature-chi}

$\chi$ encodes a non-energetic relational scale of relaxation from
which duration, distance, and causal ordering are reconstructed.
The notation $\chi(x^\mu)$ is representational: spacetime coordinates
serve as labels for relational information in regimes where a stable
geometric description has emerged.
$\chi$ should not be interpreted as a matter field on spacetime, a
scalar coupled to a pre-existing metric, or a hidden-variable
replacement for the wavefunction.
Spacetime is an emergent bookkeeping structure \emph{for} $\chi$, not
a container \emph{of} $\chi$.
