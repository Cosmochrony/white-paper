\subsection{Status of the Formulation}
\label{subsec:status-formulation}

The framework is minimal yet structurally complete at the conceptual
level.
A fully covariant action principle and systematic quantization remain
open technical extensions, not conceptual deficiencies.
GR and QFT emerge as effective, coarse-grained descriptions within
specific dynamical regimes of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.
Cosmochrony should be viewed as a foundational framework clarifying
what is fundamental and how known structures arise, rather than as a
closed effective field theory.
