\subsection{Antiparticles}
    \label{subsec:antiparticles}

  Antiparticles are interpreted as phase-inverted counterparts of particle excitations.
  Their annihilation corresponds to topological unwinding, releasing stored curvature energy back into propagating
  $\chi$ waves.

  This process conserves total $\chi$-structure while converting localized constraints into delocalized radiation.
