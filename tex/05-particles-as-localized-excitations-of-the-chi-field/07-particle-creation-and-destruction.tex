\subsection{Particle Creation and Destruction}
    \label{subsec:particle-creation-and-destruction}

  Particles are created when propagating $\chi$
  waves self-interfere or interact with existing excitations strongly enough to form stable localized
  configurations.
  Conversely, particle destruction corresponds to the loss of topological stability through interaction or
  decoherence.

  This view removes the need for particle ontology as a primitive concept and replaces it with a purely
  dynamical description.
