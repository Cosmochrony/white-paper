\subsection{Mass as Resistance to $\chi$ Relaxation}
  \label{subsec:mass-as-resistance-to-chi-relaxation}

  In this framework, mass is not an intrinsic attribute but an emergent measure of how strongly a localized
  excitation resists the local increase of $\chi$.

  Regions containing particle excitations exhibit increased spatial gradients:
  \begin{equation}
    |\nabla \chi| > 0 ,
  \end{equation}
  which, according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:chi_dynamics}, reduces the local relaxation rate $\partial_t \chi$.

  This reduction manifests macroscopically as time dilation and gravitational mass.

  Mapping of the energy of solitons with the masses of observed particles is detailled in ~\ref{subsec:soliton_energy_mass}.
