\subsection{Energy--Frequency Relation}
  \label{subsec:energy-frequency-solitons}

  The energy associated with a particle excitation is linked to the internal oscillation frequency of its wave
  configuration.
  Higher-frequency structures correspond to tighter localization and stronger gradients in $\chi$.

  This provides a geometric interpretation of the relation
  \begin{equation}
    E \propto \nu ,
  \end{equation}
  with Planck's constant emerging as an effective proportionality factor determined by the properties of the $\chi$
  field rather than assumed as a fundamental constant.

  A more explicit geometric derivation of this relation, in the context of radiation and photon-like
  excitations of the $\chi$ field, will be presented in Section~\ref{subsec:energy-frequency-radiation}.
