  \subsection{Particles as Stable Wave Configurations}
  \label{subsec:particles-as-stable-wave-configurations}

  Within the Cosmochrony framework, particles are not fundamental point-like objects but stable, localized
  excitations of the $\chi$ field\cite{Rajaraman1982}.
  They correspond to persistent wave configurations that locally constrain the relaxation of $\chi$.

  These configurations may be interpreted as soliton-like structures: they maintain their identity during
  propagation and interaction, while remaining fully embedded in the underlying $\chi$ dynamics.
