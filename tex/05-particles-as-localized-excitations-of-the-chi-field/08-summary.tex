\subsection{Summary}
  \label{subsec:summary7}

  Particles emerge as stable, localized excitations of the $\chi$ field that resist its relaxation.
  Their mass, energy, spin, and statistics follow from geometric and topological properties of $\chi$,
  providing a unified description compatible with both relativistic and quantum phenomena.
