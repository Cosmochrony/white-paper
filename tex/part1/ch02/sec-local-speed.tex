\subsection{Local Relaxation Speed}
\label{subsec:local-relaxation-speed}

The effective local ordering rate associated with projected $\chi$
configurations is bounded.
In effective geometric descriptions, this constraint takes the form
\begin{equation}
  \left| \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{loc}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}} \right| \le c ,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{loc}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ denotes an
effective local relaxation functional.
This inequality limits the maximal rate at which effective causal
connectivity can be established within admissible descriptions.
The quantity~$c$ characterizes the causal structure of the projected regime.

Local particle propagation, signal transmission, and field interactions are
all constrained by this bound in effective spacetime descriptions.
Apparent superluminal recession velocities at cosmological scales arise from
cumulative global effects of projected ordering and do not violate this
local causal constraint.
