\section{The \texorpdfstring{$\chi$}{χ} Substrate: Definition, Properties,
and Ontology}
\label{sec:definition-and-fundamental-properties-of-the-chi-field}

This section introduces the single fundamental entity at the core of
Cosmochrony: the pre-geometric relational substrate~$\chi$.
We identify the minimal structural properties required for effective
descriptions of spacetime, dynamics, and physical observables to arise in
appropriate regimes, and we clarify the ontological status of~$\chi$ and its
relation to emergent physical quantities.

No spacetime manifold, metric structure, or background geometry is assumed.
Geometric and dynamical notions are recovered only through non-injective,
coarse-grained projections of~$\chi$ configurations once suitable stability
conditions are met.
This minimality principle, referred to as a regime of \emph{ontological
poverty}, is adopted as a foundational constraint.
