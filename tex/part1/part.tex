\part{Foundations}
  \label{part:foundations}

  This part establishes the conceptual and ontological basis of the Cosmochrony framework.
  Its purpose is to introduce the minimal assumptions required to describe physical reality
  without presupposing spacetime, geometry, or quantization as fundamental primitives.

  We define the pre-geometric relational substrate $\chi$, clarify its ontological status,
  and identify the structural principles governing its admissible configurations.
  Special emphasis is placed on the role of non-injective projection, bounded relaxation,
  and intrinsic ordering as the common origin of time, geometry, and physical observables.

  Rather than postulating spacetime or fields a priori, this part shows how effective
  geometric and dynamical descriptions arise only in specific projective regimes.
  All subsequent developments rely on the definitions, conventions, and limitations
  introduced here, which will not be reiterated in later parts.
