\part{Foundations}
  \label{part:foundations}

  This part establishes the conceptual and ontological foundations of the Cosmochrony framework.
  Its purpose is to state explicitly the minimal assumptions from which all subsequent
  developments follow, without presupposing spacetime, geometry, or quantization as
  fundamental primitives.

  We introduce the pre-geometric relational substrate $\chi$, clarify its ontological
  status, and define the structural principles governing its admissible configurations.
  Central notions such as non-injective projection, bounded relaxation, intrinsic ordering,
  and effective projectability are defined in a canonical manner and will be used throughout
  the document without repetition.

  Effective geometric, dynamical, and temporal descriptions are shown to arise only within
  restricted projective regimes.
  This part therefore serves as the reference layer for all later physical interpretations,
  formal developments, and phenomenological applications.
