\subsection{Parameter-Independent Relaxation}
\label{subsec:parameter-independent-relaxation}

Physical evolution appears only at the effective level, as an ordered
sequence of projected $\chi$ configurations
$(\chi_{\mathrm{eff},\lambda})$, where $\lambda$ is a strictly monotonic
ordering parameter labeling admissible stages of relaxation.
The ordering parameter~$\lambda$ does not represent time; it serves as an
index ordering projected configurations once a macroscopic spacetime
description becomes applicable.

Admissible projected descriptions are constrained by an effective
relaxation condition:
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{D}_{\lambda}\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}
    = \mathcal{R}[\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}] ,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{R}[\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}]$ denotes an effective relaxation
functional characterizing the ordering of projected configurations.
This relation is a consistency condition on admissible projections, not a
fundamental dynamical law.
The functional~$\mathcal{R}$ is defined only in regimes admitting a stable
geometric interpretation.

Quantities commonly interpreted as temporal derivatives arise exclusively
within effective descriptions.
Within this framework, relaxation does not occur \emph{in} time; the
ordering of projected configurations defines what is operationally
identified as physical duration.
