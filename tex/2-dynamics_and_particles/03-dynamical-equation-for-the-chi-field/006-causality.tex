\subsection{Causality and Locality}
\label{subsec:causality-and-locality}

Within effective descriptions, the relaxation ordering encoded by
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ exhibits locality and causality.
Effective locality follows from the fact that variations of
$\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ at a given effective event depend only on correlated
neighboring projected configurations.
Causality is enforced through the universal bound
\[
  \left| \mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{loc}} \chi_{\mathrm{eff}} \right| \le c ,
\]
constraining the maximal rate at which correlations between effective
configurations may be established.
No superluminal propagation of signals or causal influence occurs within
effective descriptions.
Apparent superluminal recession velocities in cosmological contexts arise
from cumulative integration of locally constrained relaxation ordering over
extended regions and remain consistent with effective locality.

The effective causal bound~$c$ corresponds to the projected manifestation
of the invariant structural bound~$c_\chi$ defined at the level of the
pre-temporal substrate
(Section~\ref{subsec:role-of-cchi}).
Effective causality arises as a derived property of bounded projective
realizations.
