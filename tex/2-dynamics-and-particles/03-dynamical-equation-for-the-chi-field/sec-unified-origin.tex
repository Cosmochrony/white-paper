\subsection{Unified Origin of Geometric and Field Effects}
\label{subsec:unified-origin}

The relation between the $\chi$ substrate and the effective spacetime
metric~$g_{\mu\nu}$ is strictly hierarchical and may be summarized in
three levels.
First, at the fundamental level, physical reality is described solely in
terms of~$\chi$ and its intrinsic relational structure.
Second, in regimes where projected configurations admit a stable and slowly
varying description, the spacetime metric arises as an effective descriptor
summarizing correlations and relaxation ordering.
Third, localized relaxation-resistant projected configurations---describable
as solitonic structures---are identified with matter degrees of freedom, and
gravitational phenomena correspond to local modulations of effective
relaxation ordering induced by such structures.

No independent gravitational interaction or fundamental field is postulated.
Matter, geometry, and gravitation emerge as complementary aspects of the
same constrained ordering of projected configurations.
