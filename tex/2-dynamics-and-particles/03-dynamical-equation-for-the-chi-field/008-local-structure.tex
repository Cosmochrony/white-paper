\subsection{Influence of Local Structure}
\label{subsec:influence-of-local-structure}

In regions where projected configurations exhibit non-vanishing effective
structural variations, the admissible local relaxation ordering is reduced.
Localized relaxation-resistant configurations---describable as particle-like
solitonic structures---act as constraints on the admissible ordering of
projected configurations.
By increasing the effective structural complexity, they locally inhibit
relaxation without introducing any additional interaction or mediator.

When a geometric description is applicable, this inhibition manifests as
gravitational time dilation and spatial curvature.
Gravitation arises as a collective consequence of locally constrained
effective relaxation ordering.
