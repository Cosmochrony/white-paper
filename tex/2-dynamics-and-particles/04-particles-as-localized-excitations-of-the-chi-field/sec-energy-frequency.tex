\subsection{Energy--Frequency Relation}
\label{subsec:energy-frequency-solitons}

The energy associated with a particle-like excitation is linked to a
characteristic internal spectral scale of the corresponding projected
configuration.
Configurations associated with higher characteristic frequencies
correspond to more tightly constrained structures and encode greater
effective resistance to relaxation.
This yields
\begin{equation}
  E \propto \nu ,
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ characterizes the spectral scale of internal organization.
Planck's constant appears as an effective proportionality factor whose
universality reflects the robustness of spectral scales in the current
relaxation epoch.
A more explicit realization in the context of radiation is presented in
Section~\ref{subsec:energy-frequency-radiation}.
