\subsection{Particles as Stable Wave Configurations}
\label{subsec:particles-as-stable-wave-configurations}

Particles are not fundamental point-like entities.
They arise at the level of effective descriptions as stable, localized
configurations within projected $\chi$
descriptions~\cite{Rajaraman1982}.
Such configurations correspond to persistent patterns that locally
constrain the admissible relaxation ordering.
In effective geometric regimes, they may be described using soliton-like
language.
Their stability reflects localized regions in which further relaxation is
strongly inhibited.
Apparent particle propagation corresponds to a continuous reorganization
of admissible projected descriptions, not to the motion of an object
through a fundamental spacetime.
