\subsection{Topological Stability}
\label{subsec:topological-stability}

The stability of particle-like excitations does not rely on fundamental
conserved charges postulated \emph{a priori}.
Certain projected configurations exhibit non-trivial internal organization
that prevents them from being continuously deformed into homogeneous
effective descriptions without violating admissibility conditions.

This stability is topological in character: it reflects the existence of
inequivalent classes of admissible projected configurations that cannot be
smoothly connected through continuous reconfiguration while preserving
monotonic relaxation ordering.
The long-lived character of solitonic structures follows from this
topological incompatibility, not from a dynamical balance of forces.

Detailed geometric constructions of topological solitons, including
vortex, skyrmion, and knotted configurations, are provided in
Appendix~\ref{app:topological_solitons}.
The fully relational formulation is developed in
Appendix~\ref{app:relational_topological_stability}.
