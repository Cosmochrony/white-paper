\section{The Projection Fiber and Gauge Emergence}
\label{sec:projection-gauge}

The projection fiber~$\Pi$ is a central structural element linking the
pre-geometric substrate~$\chi$ to effective spacetime descriptions.
It encodes the admissible equivalence classes and internal degrees of
freedom through which relational configurations of~$\chi$ can be
consistently projected into geometric and field-like representations.

Gauge interactions do not arise from fundamental interaction fields.
They emerge as symmetry structures of the projection process itself,
under local re-identification of equivalent representatives along the
fiber.
This section develops the geometry of the projection fiber and clarifies
how distinct classes of gauge phenomena naturally emerge from its
structure.
