\part{Dynamics and Particles}
  \label{part:dynamics-and-particles}

  This part develops the effective dynamics of the $\chi$ substrate and explains how
  localized, long-lived excitations emerge as particle-like structures.
  Starting from a parameter-independent relaxation principle, we derive the effective
  evolution equations governing $\chi$ and identify the conditions under which stable or
  metastable configurations arise.

  Particles are interpreted not as fundamental objects but as structured excitations of the
  substrate, characterized by spectral, topological, and relaxation properties.
  Within this framework, inertial mass, energy--frequency relations, charge, spin, and
  antiparticles emerge as effective attributes of projected $\chi$ configurations.

  The projection fiber and its transmittance properties are then introduced, providing a
  unified interpretation of gauge structures and internal symmetries.
  This part establishes the physical content of matter and interactions prior to any
  gravitational or quantum description.
